        typically involve a multi-step process that ensures thorough treatment
        and maximum benefits. Here's a step-by-step overview of what to expect
        during a Brazilian skin lightening facial:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h6>1. Cleansing:</h6>The facial begins with a gentle cleansing to
          remove dirt, oil, and impurities from the skin. This step prepares the
          skin for the subsequent treatments and ensures better absorption of
          the active ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>2. Exfoliation:</h6> Exfoliation is carried out using products
          containing natural enzymes or mild acids. This step helps in removing
          dead skin cells, unclogging pores, and promoting cell turnover,
          revealing fresher and brighter skin.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>3. Application of Lightening Serums:</h6> Specialized serums
          containing ingredients like Vitamin C, licorice extract, and arbutin
          are applied to the skin. These serums penetrate deep into the skin to
          target pigmentation and promote an even skin tone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>4. Facial Massage:</h6> A relaxing facial massage is performed to
          stimulate blood circulation and enhance the absorption of the active
          ingredients. The massage also helps in relaxing facial muscles and
          reducing stress.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>5. Mask Application: </h6> A mask enriched with skin lightening
          and hydrating ingredients is applied to the face. The mask is left on
          for a specific duration to allow the ingredients to penetrate deeply
          and work their magic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>6. Moisturization and Sun Protection: </h6>The facial concludes
          with the application of a moisturizer and sunscreen. Moisturization
          helps in locking in the benefits of the facial, while sunscreen
          protects the skin from UV damage and prevents further pigmentation.
