      <h3>What is Acne?</h3>
      <p>
        Acne is a common skin condition that occurs when hair follicles become
        clogged with oil and dead skin cells. It often results in pimples,
        blackheads, whiteheads, and in severe cases, cysts and nodules. Acne can
        affect individuals of all ages but is most prevalent during adolescence.

        <li>
          <span>Hormonal Changes:</span> Fluctuations in hormones, especially during
          puberty, menstruation, or pregnancy, can lead to increased oil
          production and acne.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Genetics:</span> A family history of acne can increase the likelihood of

        <li>
          <span>Stress:</span> Stress can trigger or worsen acne by increasing oil
          production.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Skincare Products:</span> Using comedogenic (pore-clogging) products can
          contribute to acne breakouts.
        </li>
        <li>
