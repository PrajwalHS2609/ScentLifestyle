        What to Expect from SCENT's Eye Protection Facial Services in Bangalore
      </h4>
      <p>
        When you book an appointment for our{" "}
        <a href="https://scentlifestyle.com/facial">Eye Protection Facial Services</a> in Bangalore, you can
        expect a comprehensive and luxurious experience. Here's a step-by-step
        overview of what our service entails:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h6>1. Consultation:</h6> Your journey begins with a personalized
          consultation with one of our expert estheticians. During this session,
          we assess your skin type, specific concerns, and overall goals. This
          helps us tailor the treatment to meet your unique needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>2. Cleansing:</h6>The facial starts with a gentle yet thorough
          cleansing of the face and eye area. This removes any makeup, dirt, and
          impurities, preparing the skin for the treatment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>3. Exfoliation:</h6> Next, we exfoliate the skin around the eyes
          to remove dead skin cells and promote cell turnover. This step is
          crucial for allowing the active ingredients in our products to
          penetrate deeply and work effectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6> 4. Massage:</h6> A relaxing massage follows, focusing on the eye
          area. This not only feels incredibly soothing but also helps to
          improve blood circulation and lymphatic drainage, reducing puffiness
          and dark circles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>5. Mask Application:</h6> A specialized eye mask is then applied,
          packed with ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, peptides, and
          vitamins. This mask provides intense hydration, nourishes the skin,
          and targets specific concerns like fine lines and dark circles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>6. Serum and Moisturizer:</h6> After the mask is removed, we apply
          a potent serum and moisturizer designed for the eye area. These
          products are chosen based on your skin's needs and are aimed at
          providing long-lasting hydration and protection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>7. Sun Protection:</h6> Finally, we apply a gentle, eye-safe
          sunscreen to protect the delicate skin around your eyes from UV
          damage. Sun protection is a crucial step in any skincare routine,
          especially for the sensitive eye area.
