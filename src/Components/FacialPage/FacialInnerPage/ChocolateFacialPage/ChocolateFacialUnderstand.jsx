      <h3>Key Ingredients and Their Benefits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span> Chocolate:</span> Rich in antioxidants, chocolate helps to
          protect the skin from free radical damage, reduce inflammation, and
          improve skin texture. It is also deeply moisturizing, making it ideal
          for dry and dehydrated skin.
        </li>
        <li>
         <span> Mint:</span> Known for its cooling and soothing properties, mint helps to
          calm irritated skin, reduce redness, and provide a refreshing
          sensation. It also has antibacterial properties that can help to
          prevent acne and other skin blemishes.
