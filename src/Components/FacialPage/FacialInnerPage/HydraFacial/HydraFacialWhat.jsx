        at SCENT in Bangalore, you can expect a luxurious and transformative
        experience. Here’s a step-by-step guide to what the treatment entails:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h6>1. Consultation:</h6> Your journey begins with a thorough
          consultation with one of our expert estheticians. They will assess
          your skin type, identify specific concerns, and customize the facial
          to meet your unique needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>2. Cleansing:</h6>The treatment starts with a gentle yet thorough
          cleansing to remove makeup, dirt, and impurities. This prepares the
          skin for the subsequent steps and ensures that the active ingredients
          can penetrate deeply.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>3. Exfoliation:</h6> Next, an exfoliating step removes dead skin
          cells, promoting cell renewal and improving the skin’s texture. This
          step is crucial for achieving a smooth and radiant complexion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>4. Marine-Based Mask:</h6> A luxurious mask infused with marine
          ingredients is then applied. This mask is rich in minerals and
          antioxidants, providing deep hydration and nourishment to the skin.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>5. Lifting Massage:</h6> A specialized lifting massage follows,
          using techniques that stimulate blood circulation and promote collagen
          production. This massage helps to tighten and firm the skin, enhancing
          the lifting effect of the facial.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>6. Serum Application:</h6> A potent serum, tailored to your skin’s
          needs, is applied to address specific concerns such as fine lines,
          wrinkles, and uneven skin tone. The serum is packed with active
          ingredients that provide long-lasting benefits.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>7. Moisturization:</h6> The facial concludes with the application
          of a high-quality moisturizer that locks in hydration and protects the
          skin from environmental aggressors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>8. Sun Protection:</h6>Finally, a gentle sunscreen is applied to
          shield your skin from harmful UV rays, ensuring that your skin remains
          protected and radiant.
