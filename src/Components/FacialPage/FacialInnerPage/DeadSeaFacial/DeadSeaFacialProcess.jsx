      <ul>
        <li>
          <h6>1. Consultation:</h6> Your treatment begins with a thorough
          consultation with one of our expert estheticians. We discuss your skin
          concerns, goals, and preferences to tailor the facial to your specific
          needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6> 2. Cleansing:</h6> The first step is a gentle cleanse to remove
          any makeup, dirt, and impurities from your skin, preparing it for the
          treatment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6> 3. Exfoliation:</h6> Using Dead Sea salt, we exfoliate your skin
          to slough off dead skin cells and reveal a smoother complexion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>4. Application of Dead Sea Mud Mask:</h6> A rich Dead Sea mud mask
          is applied to your face, providing deep hydration and detoxification.
          The mask is left on for a specified time to allow the minerals to
          penetrate the skin.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>5. Massage:</h6> A soothing facial massage follows, using
          nourishing oils to promote relaxation and improve blood circulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>6. Rinsing and Moisturizing:</h6> The mask is rinsed off, and a
          hydrating moisturizer is applied to lock in moisture and nourish the
          skin.
        </li>
