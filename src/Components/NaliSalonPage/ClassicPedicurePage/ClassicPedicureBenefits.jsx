      <h5>Benefits of Regular Pedicures</h5>
      <p>
        Regular pedicures offer numerous benefits beyond just aesthetic appeal.
        Here are some reasons why you should make pedicures a regular part of
        your self-care routine:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h6> Improved Foot Health:</h6> Regular pedicures help to keep your
          feet healthy by preventing issues such as fungal infections, ingrown
          nails, and calluses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>Better Circulation:</h6> The foot massage included in pedicures
          improves blood flow to your feet and lower legs, which can help reduce
          pain and swelling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>Stress Relief:</h6> Taking time to relax and pamper yourself can
          significantly reduce stress levels. The soothing environment and
          gentle touch of a pedicure can provide a much-needed mental break.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>Enhanced Appearance:</h6> Well-groomed feet and nails enhance your
          overall appearance and boost your confidence, especially during sandal
          season.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>Early Detection of Issues:</h6> Regular visits to a professional
          can help identify potential foot problems early, allowing for timely
          treatment and prevention of more serious conditions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
