          <li>
            <span>Versatile Designs: </span>The ombre effect can be customized
            with various colors and patterns, allowing you to express your
            personality and style. Whether you prefer a natural look with nude
            tones or a vibrant and eye-catching design, the possibilities are
            endless.

          <li>
            <span>High Gloss Finish: </span> Gel nail polish provides a
            high-shine finish that remains glossy throughout its wear. The ombre
            effect enhances this shine, giving your nails a polished and
            sophisticated appearance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Strengthens Natural Nails: </span>Gel nail polish acts as a
            protective layer, strengthening your natural nails and preventing
            them from breaking or peeling. This is especially beneficial for
            those with weak or brittle nails.
