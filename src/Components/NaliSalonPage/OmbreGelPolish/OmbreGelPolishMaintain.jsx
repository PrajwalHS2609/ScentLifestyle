      <h5>Aftercare Tips for Ombre Gel Nails</h5>
      <p>
        To keep your <a href="https://scentlifestyle.com/ombre-gel-nail-polish">ombre gel nails</a> looking their best for as
        long as possible, here are some aftercare tips:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h6>Avoid Harsh Chemicals</h6>Exposure to harsh chemicals can dull the
          shine of your chrome gel polish. Wear gloves when doing household
          chores.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>Moisturize Regularly: </h6>Keep your cuticles and nails hydrated
          by applying cuticle oil and hand cream regularly. This helps prevent
          dryness and keeps your nails healthy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>Avoid Using Nails as Tools: </h6> Using your nails to open
          packages or perform other tasks can cause them to chip or break. Use
          appropriate tools instead.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>Schedule Regular Touch-Ups: </h6>To maintain the look of your
          <a href="https://scentlifestyle.com/ombre-gel-nail-polish">ombre gel nails</a>, schedule regular touch-up appointments
          at SCENT. This will ensure your nails always look fresh and
          flawless.
