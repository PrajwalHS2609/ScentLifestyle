      <ul>
        <li>
          1. <span>Consultation:</span> Your manicure experience begins with a
          consultation with one of our expert nail technicians. They will assess
          the condition of your nails and hands and discuss your preferences and
          any specific concerns you may have.
        </li>
        <li>
          2. <span>Nail Shaping:</span> We start by trimming and shaping your
          nails to your desired length and shape. This step ensures that your
          nails look neat and uniform.
        </li>
        <li>
          3. <span>Cuticle Care:</span> Our technician will carefully push back
          and trim your cuticles, removing any dead skin. This not only enhances
          the appearance of your nails but also promotes healthy growth.
        </li>
        <li>
          4. <span>Exfoliation:</span> We use a gentle exfoliant to remove dead
          skin cells from your hands and forearms. This process leaves your skin
          feeling smooth and revitalized.
        </li>
        <li>
          5. <span>Hand Massage:</span> A relaxing hand massage is performed
          using a nourishing lotion. This step helps to improve circulation,
          relieve stress, and hydrate your skin.
        </li>
        <li>
          6. <span>Polish Application:</span> Finally, we apply a base coat,
          followed by your choice of high-quality nail polish, and finish with a
          top coat to seal and protect your nails. You can choose from a wide
          range of colors to suit your style and mood.
        </li>
        <li>
          7. <span>Drying:</span> Your nails are then left to dry completely. We
          may use a quick-dry spray or UV lamp to speed up the process, ensuring
          your polish sets perfectly.
        </li>
