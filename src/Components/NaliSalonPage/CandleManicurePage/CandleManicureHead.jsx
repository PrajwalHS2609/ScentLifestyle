        <h2>What is a Candle Spa Manicure?</h2>
        <p>
          A Candle Spa Manicure is more than just a manicure; it is an
          indulgent, sensory journey that combines the soothing elements of
          candle wax and aromatic essential oils with the meticulous care of a
          traditional manicure. This treatment is designed to nourish your skin,
          strengthen your nails, and leave your hands feeling silky smooth and
          rejuvenated.
