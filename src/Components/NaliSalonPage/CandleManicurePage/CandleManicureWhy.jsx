      <h5>The Candle Spa Manicure Experience</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h6>Warm Welcome :</h6> Upon arriving at SCENT, you will be greeted by
          our friendly and professional staff who are dedicated to ensuring your
          comfort and relaxation. Our serene and inviting ambiance sets the tone
          for your luxurious spa experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>Consultation :</h6> Our experienced nail technicians will begin
          with a brief consultation to understand your specific needs and
          preferences. Whether you have concerns about nail health, skin
          hydration, or simply want to unwind, we tailor the <a href="https://scentlifestyle.com/candle-spa-manicure">Candle Spa Manicure</a>
          to meet your desires.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>Aromatic Hand Soak :</h6> The treatment starts with an aromatic
          hand soak infused with essential oils to soften the skin and prepare
          it for the manicure. This soothing soak not only cleanses but also
          relaxes your hands, setting the stage for the ultimate pampering.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>Exfoliation :</h6> Next, your hands will be gently exfoliated using
          a natural scrub. This step removes dead skin cells, promoting healthy
          skin regeneration and leaving your hands feeling smooth and
          revitalized. The exfoliation process is thorough yet gentle, ensuring
          your skin remains healthy and radiant.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6> Nail and Cuticle Care :</h6> Our skilled technicians will
          meticulously trim, shape, and buff your nails to perfection. Cuticle
          care is an essential part of this process, ensuring that your nails
          are healthy and well-groomed. We use high-quality tools and products
          to achieve the best results.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>Candle Wax Massage : </h6> The highlight of the Candle Spa Manicure
          is the luxurious candle wax massage. Specially formulated massage
          candles are melted, and the warm, aromatic wax is poured over your
          hands. The melted wax transforms into a rich, nourishing oil that is
          gently massaged into your skin. This step not only hydrates and
          softens your skin but also provides deep relaxation and stress relief.
          The warm wax helps to improve blood circulation, leaving your hands
          feeling rejuvenated and revitalized.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6> Moisturizing Mask :</h6> After the massage, a moisturizing mask is
          applied to your hands to lock in the hydration and nutrients. This
          mask is left on for a few minutes to allow the ingredients to
          penetrate deeply into your skin. During this time, you can unwind and
          enjoy the calming atmosphere of our salon.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>Polish Perfection :</h6> If you choose to add a pop of color to
          your nails, our technicians will expertly apply your selected polish.
          We offer a wide range of high-quality polishes, including classic
          shades and trendy colors, ensuring you leave with perfectly polished
          nails. If you prefer a natural look, we can provide a clear or nude
          polish that enhances the natural beauty of your nails.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>Finishing Touches :</h6> The Candle Spa Manicure concludes with
          the application of a nourishing hand cream to keep your skin soft and
          hydrated. Our technicians will also give your hands a final massage,
          ensuring you leave feeling completely pampered and relaxed.
