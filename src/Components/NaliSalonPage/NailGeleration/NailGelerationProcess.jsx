          <span>1. Consultation:</span>Our technicians will begin with a
          consultation to understand your preferences and any specific
          requirements you may have. This helps us tailor the treatment to suit

          smooth surface for the gel application.

          <span>3. Gel Application:</span> The chosen gel color will be applied
          in thin layers. Each layer is cured under a UV or LED lamp to harden
          the gel and ensure a durable finish.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>4. Finishing Touches:</span> Once the gel application is
          complete, a top coat is applied for added shine and protection. Your
          nails will then be gently cleaned and moisturized.
