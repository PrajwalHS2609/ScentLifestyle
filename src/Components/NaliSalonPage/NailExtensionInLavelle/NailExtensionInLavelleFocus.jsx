      <p>
        We provide several types of nail extensions near Lavelle Road to suit
        your preferences, lifestyle, and aesthetic goals:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>Acrylic Extensions</h6>
        <p>
         Known for their strength and durability, acrylic
          extensions are ideal for those looking to add significant length. Our
          skilled technicians carefully sculpt acrylic to create the perfect
          shape for each client.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Gel Extensions</h6>
        <p>
           For a lighter, more natural look, gel extensions are
          a popular choice. Gel nails are flexible, shiny, and chip-resistant,
          making them a great option if you want a subtle yet elegant look.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> Silk and Fiberglass Wraps </h6>
        <p>
          Ideal for those with sensitive nails,
          silk or fiberglass wraps provide reinforcement without the bulk of
          other types of extensions. These wraps are especially beneficial if
          you want extra strength without added length.
        </p>
      </li>{" "}
      <li>
        <h6>PolyGel Extensions</h6>
        <p>
           A hybrid of acrylic and gel, PolyGel extensions
          are durable yet lighter than traditional acrylic. This option combines
          the best of both worlds, creating nails that feel natural and are less
          prone to damage.
