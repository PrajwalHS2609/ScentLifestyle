          Acrylic nails are strong, durable, and perfect for those looking to

          for creating beautiful shapes and bold styles. Acrylic nails are

        <h6>Gel Nail Extensions</h6>
        <p>
          If you prefer a natural, lightweight option, gel nails are the perfect
          solution. Gel nail extensions are more flexible than acrylic and
          provide a shiny, glossy finish. They are perfect for anyone looking
          for long-lasting, smooth nails that look and feel natural.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> Polygel Nail Extensions </h6>
        <p>
          For the best of both worlds, polygel nails combine the flexibility of
          gel nails with the durability of acrylic nails. Polygel is a
          lightweight material that is perfect for clients who want strength and
          flexibility. The result is a natural, long-lasting finish that is
          ideal for those who want both aesthetics and durability in their nail
          extensions near Uptown Whitefield.

        <h6>Silk and Fiberglass Nail Wraps</h6>
        <p>
          Silk and fiberglass wraps offer a softer, more natural approach to
          nail extensions. These wraps are ideal for those who want a subtle
          enhancement to their natural nails. They provide added strength and
          are a great option for individuals with more delicate or fragile
          nails.
