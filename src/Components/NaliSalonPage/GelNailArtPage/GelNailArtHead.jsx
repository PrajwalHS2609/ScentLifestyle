        <h3>Why Choose Gel Nail Art?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>Durability:</span> Gel nails are less prone to chipping and
            can last up to three weeks with proper care.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>High Shine:</span> The curing process leaves a glossy finish
            that remains intact throughout the wear period.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Quick Drying:</span> Once cured under the light, your nails
            are completely dry and ready to go.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Versatility:</span> Gel nail art allows for a variety of
            designs, from simple solid colors to intricate patterns and
            embellishments.
