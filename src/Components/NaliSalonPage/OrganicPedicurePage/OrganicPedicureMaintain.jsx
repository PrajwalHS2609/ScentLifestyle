      <h5>Maintaining Your Organic Pedicure at Home</h5>
      <p>
        To extend the benefits of your Organic Pedicure, here are some tips for
        maintaining your feet at home:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h6>Daily Moisturization:</h6> Keep your feet hydrated by applying an
          organic foot cream daily. This helps to prevent dryness and cracking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>Proper Footwear:</h6> Choose comfortable shoes that provide
          adequate support. Avoid wearing tight or ill-fitting shoes that can
          cause blisters and other foot issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>Regular Cleaning:</h6> Wash your feet daily with a gentle, organic
          soap and dry them thoroughly, especially between the toes, to prevent
          fungal infections.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h6>Nail Care:</h6> Regularly trim your nails to maintain their
          shape and prevent ingrown nails. Be sure to cut them straight across
          to avoid problems.
        </li>
      </ul>
