        <h6>2. Communicate Your Preferences::</h6>
        <p>
          Let our therapists know about any specific concerns or preferences you
          have. Whether it’s the pressure of a massage or the type of facial
          treatment, clear communication ensures you receive a customized
          experience at our Spa in JP Nagar.
        </p>
      </li>

        <h6> 3.Stay Hydrated:</h6>
        <p>
          Drinking plenty of water before and after your spa visit helps keep
          your body hydrated and supports the detoxification process. Hydration
          is essential for maintaining the benefits of your spa treatments.

        <h6> 4.Follow Post-Treatment Care:</h6>
        <p>
          Follow any aftercare instructions provided by our staff to prolong the
          effects of your treatment. Whether it’s applying a moisturizer or
          avoiding sun exposure, proper care enhances your results.
