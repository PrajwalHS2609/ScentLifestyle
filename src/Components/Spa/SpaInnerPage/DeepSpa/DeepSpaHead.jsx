      <h3>Understanding Deep Tissue Massage</h3>
      <p>
        Deep tissue massage is a therapeutic technique that focuses on the
        deeper layers of muscles and connective tissues. Unlike other massage
        styles that primarily target surface muscles, deep tissue massage
        involves applying firm pressure and slow strokes to reach deeper muscle
        layers. This type of massage is particularly beneficial for individuals
        with chronic pain, sports injuries, or muscle stiffness. It helps to
        break down scar tissue, release muscle knots, and improve overall
        mobility.
