      <h3>The Importance of Back Massage</h3>
      <p>
        Back pain and discomfort are common issues faced by many individuals,
        often resulting from prolonged sitting, poor posture, or physical
        strain. A <a href="https://scentlifestyle.com/spa">back massage </a>targets the muscles and tissues in
        the back, providing relief from pain and tension. This therapeutic
        treatment not only addresses physical discomfort but also promotes
        overall well-being by reducing stress and improving mental clarity. In a
        city like Bangalore, where the fast-paced lifestyle can be overwhelming,
        a back massage offers a much-needed escape and rejuvenation.
