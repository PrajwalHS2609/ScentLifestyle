      <h3>Types of Head Massage in Bangalore</h3>
      <p>
        Bangalore offers a variety of head massage techniques to suit individual
        preferences and needs. The traditional Ayurvedic head massage, using
        herbal oils, is popular for its therapeutic properties. Another
        sought-after option is the Shirodhara, where a continuous stream of warm
        oil is poured onto the forehead, creating a deeply meditative
        experience. Aromatherapy head massages, using essential oils, are also
        available for those who seek relaxation and rejuvenation. No matter the
        type, a Head Massage in Bangalore ensures a holistic experience.
