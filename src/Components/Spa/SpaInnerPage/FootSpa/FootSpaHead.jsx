        Foot massage has been practiced for centuries across various cultures as
        a means of promoting overall well-being. It involves the application of
        pressure to specific points on the feet, which correspond to different
        organs and systems in the body. This holistic approach helps in
        alleviating stress, improving blood circulation, and providing relief
        from pain. In a city like Bangalore, where the daily grind can be
