          Hot Stone Therapy Massage in Bangalore
        </a>{" "}
        is performed by skilled therapists who carefully place heated stones on
        specific points of the body and use them to massage the muscles.
      </p>
      <p>
        This therapy involves a combination of traditional massage techniques
        and the application of heated stones, which helps to loosen tight
        muscles, increase blood circulation, and improve overall well-being. The
        smooth, flat stones are typically made of basalt, a type of volcanic
        rock that retains heat well. The stones are heated to a comfortable
        temperature and used as tools in the therapist's hands or placed along
        the spine, shoulders, and other key areas to enhance the massage
        experience.
