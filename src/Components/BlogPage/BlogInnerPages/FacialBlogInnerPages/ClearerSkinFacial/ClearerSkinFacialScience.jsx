      <h3>The Science Behind Acne Cure Facials</h3>
      <p>
        Acne Cure Facials combine multiple steps to treat acne comprehensively.
        Here's how they work:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6> Deep Cleansing</h6>
        <p>
          A thorough cleansing removes dirt, excess oil, and impurities that
          clog pores. This step prepares the skin for the treatment, ensuring
          maximum absorption of active ingredients.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> Exfoliation </h6>
        <p>
          Dead skin cells are one of the primary culprits behind clogged pores.
          Acne Cure Facials use gentle exfoliation techniques, such as chemical
          peels or enzyme masks, to slough off these cells and reveal fresh,
          healthy skin underneath.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> Extraction </h6>
        <p>
          Proper extraction is key to clearing blackheads and whiteheads without
          causing damage. Skilled professionals use precise techniques to unclog
          pores safely, reducing the risk of further inflammation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> Soothing Masks and Serums</h6>
        <p>
          After cleansing and exfoliation, soothing masks and serums infused
          with acne-fighting ingredients like salicylic acid, tea tree oil, or
          niacinamide are applied. These products calm redness, reduce swelling,
          and help control oil production.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> LED Therapy </h6>
        <p>
          Many Acne Cure Facials include blue light therapy, a non-invasive
          treatment that targets acne-causing bacteria and reduces inflammation.
          This cutting-edge technology accelerates the healing process and
          promotes clearer skin.
