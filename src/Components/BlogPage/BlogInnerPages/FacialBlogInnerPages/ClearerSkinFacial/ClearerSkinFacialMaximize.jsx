        following tips:

            <img src={point} alt="point" />  Stick to a Consistent Routine
          </span>
          <p>
            Regular sessions are essential for long-term improvement. Discuss
            with your skincare professional how often you should schedule your
            facials.

          </span>
          <p>
            After an Acne Cure Facial, your skin may be more sensitive. Avoid
            harsh products and sun exposure, and focus on hydration and gentle
            care.

          </span>
          <p>
            A proper at-home skincare routine complements professional
            treatments. Use products recommended by your dermatologist or
            esthetician to maintain the results.

          </span>
          <p>
            Drinking plenty of water and eating a balanced diet can
            significantly impact your skinâ€™s health. Foods rich in antioxidants
            and omega-3 fatty acids can reduce inflammation and support clearer
            skin.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These facials can be customized for teenagers, adults, and even those
        with sensitive skin.
