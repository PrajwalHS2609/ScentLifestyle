      <h2>Start with a Relaxing Skincare Routine</h2>
      <p>
        Flawless skin is the foundation of any great beauty look. Start
        preparing your skin at least a day in advance to allow it to be at its
        best on Valentineâ€™s Day.

        <h6>1. Exfoliate:</h6>
        <p>
           Begin by gently exfoliating your skin to remove dead skin
          cells, revealing a fresh and radiant complexion. Use a mild scrub or a
          chemical exfoliant with AHAs or BHAs for a smoother surface.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>2. Hydrate:</h6>
        <p>
           Follow up with a hydrating face mask or sheet mask to
          replenish moisture and give your skin a dewy glow. Ingredients like
          hyaluronic acid, honey, and aloe vera are excellent choices.
        </p>

        <h6>3. Serums & Moisturizers:</h6>
        <p>
           Apply a nourishing serum rich in vitamin C or
          niacinamide to brighten your skin. Lock in the hydration with a
          lightweight moisturizer suited to your skin type.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>4. Under-Eye Care:</h6>
        <p>
           Use an under-eye cream or patches to reduce
          puffiness and brighten your under-eye area, ensuring you look fresh
          and well-rested.
