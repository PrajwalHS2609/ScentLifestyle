      <h3>Tips for a Better Waxing Experience</h3>

      <li>
        <h6>1. Exfoliate Before Waxing</h6>
        <p>
          Exfoliating your skin before waxing helps to remove dead skin cells
          and allows the wax to adhere better to the hair, resulting in a
          smoother wax. Exfoliating also reduces the risk of ingrown hairs after
          waxing. Be sure to use a gentle exfoliator and avoid harsh scrubbing.{" "}

      <li>
        <h6>2. Avoid Sun Exposure Before and After Waxing</h6>
        <p>
          Sun exposure can make your skin more sensitive, so it’s best to avoid
          tanning or sunbathing for 24 to 48 hours before and after your waxing
          session. This will reduce the risk of irritation and ensure that your
          skin stays smooth and healthy.{" "}
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>3. Stay Consistent with Waxing</h6>
        <p>
          For the best results, try to stick with a regular waxing schedule.
          While the hair may be sparse and fine after the first few sessions,
          continued waxing can weaken the hair follicle, making it easier to
          remove hair in the future. Regular waxing can also reduce the pain
          associated with the procedure.{" "}
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>4. Don’t Wax If You’re Using Certain Medications</h6>
        <p>
          Certain medications, such as retinoid and acne treatments, can make
          your skin more sensitive and prone to irritation. Always consult with
          a professional or your doctor before waxing if you’re using any
          medication that could affect your skin’s sensitivity.
