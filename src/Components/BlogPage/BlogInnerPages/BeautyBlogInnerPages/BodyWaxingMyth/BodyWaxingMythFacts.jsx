      <h3>Facts About Body Waxing</h3>

      <li>
        <h6>Fact 1. Waxing Gives Longer-Lasting Results</h6>
        <p>
          Unlike shaving, which only removes hair at the surface level, waxing
          pulls the hair out from the root. This results in smoother skin that
          lasts longer. Typically, the results of body waxing can last anywhere
          from 3 to 6 weeks, depending on how fast your hair grows. As the hair
          grows back, it tends to be finer and less noticeable.

        <h6>Fact 2. Waxing Helps Prevent Ingrown Hairs</h6>
        <p>
          One of the benefits of waxing is that it helps prevent ingrown hairs,
          which occur when hair grows back incorrectly after shaving. Waxing
          removes the hair from the root, so it grows back in a straight line
          rather than curling back into the skin. This reduces the likelihood of
          painful ingrown hairs, especially in areas like the legs, arms, and
          Brazilian region.

        <h6>Fact 3. Waxing Saves Time in the Long Run</h6>
        <p>
          While waxing may require a bit of time upfront to schedule and perform
          the procedure, the long-lasting results make it a time-saver in the
          long run. You won’t need to worry about shaving every few days or
          dealing with stubble. For people with busy schedules, waxing can be a
          convenient and efficient hair removal option.
