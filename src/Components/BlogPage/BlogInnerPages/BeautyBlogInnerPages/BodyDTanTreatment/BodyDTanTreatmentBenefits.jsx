          <p>
            Prolonged sun exposure often leads to dark spots and
            hyperpigmentation. Body D-Tan treatments work to lighten these areas
            by removing the tan caused by UV rays, thus promoting an even skin
            tone.

            One of the crucial roles of Body D-Tan in Anti-Aging Skincare is its
            ability to exfoliate dead skin cells. This exfoliation reveals a
            fresh layer of skin, making your complexion appear brighter and more
            youthful.
