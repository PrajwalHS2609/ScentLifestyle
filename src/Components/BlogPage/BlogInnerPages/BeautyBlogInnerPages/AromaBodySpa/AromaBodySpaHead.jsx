      <h5>What is an Aroma Body Spa?</h5>
      <p>
        An Aroma Body Spa is a holistic wellness therapy that combines full body
        spa techniques with the therapeutic benefits of essential oils. The
        process involves a gentle, soothing massage using aromatic essential
        oils, which are carefully selected based on their healing properties.
        These oils penetrate the skin and enter the bloodstream, helping to
        relieve stress, relax muscles, and improve overall well-being.
