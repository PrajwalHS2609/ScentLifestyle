      <h3>The Process of an Aroma Body Spa</h3>
      <p>
        A typical Aroma Body Spa session follows a structured process to ensure
        maximum relaxation and therapeutic benefits:
      </p>

      <li>
        <h6>1. Consultation and Oil Selection</h6>
        <p>
          Before the body spa treatment begins, a therapist will discuss your
          needs and preferences. Based on this consultation, a blend of
          essential oils will be selected to target specific concerns such as
          stress relief, pain management, or skin hydration.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>2. Warm Oil Application</h6>
        <p>
          The session starts with the gentle application of warm essential oils
          all over the body. These oils are massaged into the skin using slow,
          rhythmic strokes to enhance absorption and relaxation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>3. Full Body Massage</h6>

          </a>{" "}
          follows, incorporating techniques such as kneading, tapping, and
          gentle pressure to relieve muscle tension and improve circulation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>4. Steam or Hot Towel Therapy</h6>
        <p>
          To further enhance the benefits, some spas offer a steam or hot towel
          therapy post-massage. This helps open the pores, allowing deeper
          penetration of the essential oils while promoting detoxification.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>5. Relaxation Period</h6>
        <p>
          After the massage, you will be given a few minutes to relax and let
          the oils work their magic. Drinking herbal tea or warm water is
          recommended to aid detoxification and maintain hydration.
