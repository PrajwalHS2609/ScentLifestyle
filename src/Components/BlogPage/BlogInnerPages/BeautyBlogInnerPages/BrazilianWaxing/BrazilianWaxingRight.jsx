        Brazilian Waxing isn’t for everyone, and that’s okay! The decision to
        get a Brazilian wax is personal and should be based on your comfort
        level and preferences. If you’re unsure, consider starting with a
        regular bikini wax to see how you feel about waxing in general before
        committing to Brazilian Waxing.
