      <h5>Brazilian Waxing: Pain Level and Comfort</h5>
      <p>
        A common concern for those considering Brazilian Waxing is the pain
        level. It’s no secret that Brazilian Waxing can be uncomfortable,
        especially for first-timers, but the pain level is generally manageable
        and lessens with each session. Here are some factors that can influence
        the discomfort:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="checked" />
            Wax Type:{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Hard wax tends to be less painful than soft wax because it adheres
            to the hair rather than the skin.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="checked" />
            Technician’s Expertise:{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            A skilled technician can make the process much quicker and less
            painful.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="checked" />
            Pain Tolerance:{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Everyone's pain threshold is different, so what one person finds
            uncomfortable, another may not.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most clients find that the results of Brazilian Waxing far outweigh the
        temporary discomfort. Plus, regular waxing can lead to thinner, sparser
        hair regrowth, making subsequent sessions easier.
