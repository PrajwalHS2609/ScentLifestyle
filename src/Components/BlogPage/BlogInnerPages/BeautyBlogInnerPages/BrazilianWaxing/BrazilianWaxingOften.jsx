      <h3>How Often Should You Get Brazilian Waxing?</h3>
      <p>
        The frequency of Brazilian Waxing largely depends on your personal hair
        growth cycle, but most people schedule their appointments every 4 to 6
        weeks. Regular waxing ensures that the hair remains soft and sparse over
        time. With consistent treatments, youâ€™ll likely notice that the regrowth
        becomes finer, making the waxing process easier with each session.
