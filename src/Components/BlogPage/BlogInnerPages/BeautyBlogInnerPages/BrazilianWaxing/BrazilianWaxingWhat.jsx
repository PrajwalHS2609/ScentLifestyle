      <h3>What to Expect During Your Brazilian Waxing Appointment</h3>
      <p>
        If you’re new to Brazilian Waxing, it’s natural to feel a bit nervous.
        Understanding what to expect can help ease your mind. Here's a
        step-by-step guide to the typical Brazilian Waxing process:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>1. Preparation:</h6> Before your appointment, your waxing technician
        will ask you to undress from the waist down and lie down on a treatment
        bed. You may be offered disposable underwear, but many Brazilian Waxing
        treatments are done without clothing in the treatment area.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 2. Cleaning the Area:</h6> Your technician will cleanse the area to
        ensure it's free from any lotions, oils, or impurities that could affect
        the waxing process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>3. Application of Wax:</h6> Brazilian Waxing can be performed using
        either soft wax (which requires strips for removal) or hard wax (which
        hardens and is removed on its own). The technician will apply the wax in
        small sections, then quickly remove the wax along with the hair.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 4. Final Touches:</h6> After the majority of hair is removed, your
        technician may use tweezers to remove any remaining stray hairs. A
        soothing lotion or oil is often applied afterward to calm the skin and
        reduce irritation.
