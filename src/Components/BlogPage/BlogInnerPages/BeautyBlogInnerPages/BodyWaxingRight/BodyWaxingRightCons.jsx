      <h3>The Cons of Body Waxing</h3>
      <li>
        <h6>1. Discomfort or Pain</h6>{" "}
        <p>
          One of the most common deterrents is the pain factor. While tolerance
          varies from person to person, waxing can cause discomfort, especially
          the first few times.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>2. Potential for Skin Irritation</h6>{" "}
        <p>
          Redness, bumps, or minor swelling can occur after waxing. These side
          effects are usually temporary but can be irritating.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>3. Ingrown Hairs</h6>{" "}
        <p>
          Although waxing can reduce ingrown hairs over time, they can still
          occur, especially if the skin isnâ€™t properly exfoliated before and
          after waxing.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>4. Cost Over Time</h6>{" "}
        <p>
          Professional waxing sessions can be more expensive than shaving or
          at-home hair removal methods. However, the trade-off is the
          longer-lasting result.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>5. Not Ideal for Everyone</h6>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Waxing may not be suitable for those with certain skin conditions like
          eczema, psoriasis, or extremely sensitive skin. It's always best to
          consult with a dermatologist or esthetician before starting a waxing
          routine.
        </p>
