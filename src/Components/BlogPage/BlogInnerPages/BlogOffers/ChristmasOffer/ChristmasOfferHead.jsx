    <h3>What Is Body Waxing?</h3>
    <p>
      Body waxing is a hair removal technique where wax is applied to the skin
      and then quickly removed, pulling hair out from the root. It is commonly
      done on larger body areas, such as the legs, arms, and back, but can
      also be used for more sensitive areas like the face and bikini line.
      Waxing is popular because it removes hair for a longer period compared
      to shaving, often leaving the skin smooth for 3 to 6 weeks.
