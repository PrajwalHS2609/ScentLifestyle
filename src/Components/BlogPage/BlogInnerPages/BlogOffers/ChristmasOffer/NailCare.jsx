      <h3>2. Nail Care: Festive and Fun Nailss</h3>
      <p>
        During the holidays, your nails can be one of your best accessories.
        Whether you prefer something subtle or bold, there are plenty of festive
        nail designs to suit every style. Here’s how you can get your nails in
        tip-top shape for Christmas.

      <li>
        <h6>Start with Healthy Nails</h6>
        <p>
          Healthy nails are the foundation of any great manicure. Ensure your
          nails are strong by using a nourishing cuticle oil and a strengthening
          base coat. Trim and file your nails regularly to keep them looking
          neat and tidy. If you're prone to dry or brittle nails, consider using
          a nail strengthener or treatment to promote growth and prevent
          splitting.

        <h6>Go Festive with Nail Art</h6>
        <p>
          From glittering snowflakes to deep red and green designs, there are
          plenty of ways to incorporate festive colors into your nails. Consider
          using metallic shades like gold, silver, or copper for a glamorous
          holiday look. If you prefer something more playful, Christmas-themed
          designs such as Santa, reindeer, and Christmas trees can bring the fun
          to your nails.
