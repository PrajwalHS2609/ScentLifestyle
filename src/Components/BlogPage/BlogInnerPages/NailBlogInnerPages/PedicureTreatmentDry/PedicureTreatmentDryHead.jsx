        <h4>Understanding the Causes of Dry and Cracked Heels</h4>
        <p>
          Before diving into treatments, itâ€™s essential to understand what
          causes dry and cracked heels. Some common culprits include:
        </p>

        <li>
          {" "}
          <span>Lack of Moisturization:</span>
          <p>
            {" "}
            Neglecting to hydrate your feet regularly can lead to dry, flaky
            skin.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Prolonged Standing:</span>
          <p>
            Standing for long periods exerts pressure on your heels, causing
            them to crack.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Improper Footwear:</span>
          <p>
            Wearing open-back shoes or ill-fitting footwear can contribute to
            dry heels.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Medical Conditions:</span>
          <p>
            Conditions like diabetes, eczema, or hypothyroidism can also lead to
            cracked heels.
          </p>
        </li>
        <p>
          A good pedicure treatment can address these issues, providing both
          immediate relief and long-term benefits.
