            While Keratin Hair Treatment does help to smooth and straighten the
            hair, it is suitable for all hair types, including curly and wavy
            hair. The treatment can be customized to meet the specific needs of
            each individual, whether you're looking to reduce frizz, enhance
            shine, or achieve a sleeker look.

            When performed by a professional and with proper aftercare, Keratin
            Hair Treatment can actually improve the health and appearance of the
            hair. The treatment helps to strengthen the hair by replenishing its
            natural keratin levels, reducing breakage, and promoting growth.

          <p>
            Keratin Hair Treatment is not permanent, and its effects will
            gradually fade over time. However, with proper care and maintenance,
            the results can last for several months. Regular touch-ups can help
            to maintain the benefits of the treatment.

          <p>
            There are various types of keratin treatments available, and it's
            important to choose a reputable salon that uses high-quality,
            formaldehyde-free products. Formaldehyde is a chemical that can be
            harmful when inhaled, so opting for formaldehyde-free treatments
            ensures a safer and healthier experience.
