        <h6>Keratin Hair Treatment Is Only for Straight Hair </h6>While Keratin
        Hair Treatment does help to smooth and straighten the hair, it is
        suitable for all hair types, including curly and wavy hair. The
        treatment can be customized to meet the specific needs of each

        <h6>Keratin Hair Treatment Damages the Hair</h6>When performed by a
        professional and with proper aftercare, Keratin Hair Treatment can
        actually improve the health and appearance of the hair. The treatment
        helps to strengthen the hair by replenishing its natural keratin levels,
        reducing breakage, and promoting growth.

      <li>
        <h6>Keratin Hair Treatment Is Permanent</h6>Keratin Hair Treatment is
        not permanent, and its effects will gradually fade over time. However,
        with proper care and maintenance, the results can last for several
        months. Regular touch-ups can help to maintain the benefits of the
        treatment.

        <h6>Keratin Hair Treatment Contains Harmful Chemicals</h6>There are
        various types of keratin treatments available, and it's important to
        choose a reputable salon that uses high-quality, formaldehyde-free
        products. Formaldehyde is a chemical that can be harmful when inhaled,
        so opting for formaldehyde-free treatments ensures a safer and healthier
        experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Keratin Hair Treatment Is Only for Women</h6>Keratin Hair Treatment
        is suitable for anyone looking to improve the health and appearance of
        their hair, regardless of gender. Men can also benefit from the
        treatment, especially those with frizzy, unruly, or damaged hair.
