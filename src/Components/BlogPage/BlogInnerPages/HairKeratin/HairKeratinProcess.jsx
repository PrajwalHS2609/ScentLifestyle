        process can help to alleviate any concerns and ensure a smooth and
        successful experience. Here is a step-by-step overview of the typical
        treatment process:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>1. Consultation </h6>The first step in the Keratin Hair Treatment
        process is a consultation with a professional stylist. During this
        consultation, the stylist will assess the condition of your hair,
        discuss your hair goals, and determine the best course of action for
        your specific needs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>2. Preparation </h6>Before the treatment begins, your hair will be
        thoroughly washed with a clarifying shampoo to remove any buildup and
        ensure that the keratin formula can penetrate the hair effectively. This
        step is crucial for achieving optimal results.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>3. Application </h6>The keratin formula is then applied to your
        hair, section by section, ensuring that each strand is evenly coated.
        The formula is typically left on the hair for a specific amount of time
        to allow the keratin to fully penetrate the hair shaft.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>4. Heat Sealing</h6>After the keratin formula has been applied and
        allowed to sit, the next step is to seal the keratin into the hair using
        heat. This is typically done with a flat iron, which helps to lock in
        the keratin and create a smooth and polished finish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>5. Post-Treatment Care</h6>Following the treatment, your stylist
        will provide you with specific aftercare instructions to ensure that you
        achieve the best possible results. This may include avoiding washing
        your hair for a certain period, using sulfate-free shampoos and
        conditioners, and minimizing the use of heat styling tools.
