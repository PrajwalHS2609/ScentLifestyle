      <h3>What Are Eyelash Extensions?</h3>
      <p>
        Eyelash extensions are semi-permanent fibers applied to your natural
        lashes to enhance their length, fullness, and curl. These aren’t your
        typical strip lashes—they’re individually applied by a professional
        technician using medical-grade adhesive for a natural or dramatic
        effect, depending on your preference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike traditional false lashes, eyelash extensions provide a
        customizable, comfortable, and long-lasting solution for achieving lush,
        beautiful lashes without the hassle of daily application.
