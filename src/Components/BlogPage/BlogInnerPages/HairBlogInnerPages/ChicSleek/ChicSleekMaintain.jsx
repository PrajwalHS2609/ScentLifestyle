      <h5> Maintaining Your Chic & Sleek Haircut</h5>
      <p>
        Once you’ve found the perfect haircut, maintaining it is key to keeping
        it looking chic and sleek. Regular trims, proper hair care, and the
        right styling products can make all the difference in how your haircut
        looks and feels.

            To keep your haircut looking fresh, it’s essential to get regular
            trims. This helps to maintain the shape of your haircut and prevent
            split ends.

            Using the right hair care products for your hair type is crucial.
            For example, if you have fine hair, opt for volumizing shampoos and
            conditioners, while those with curly hair should look for
            moisturizing and curl-defining products.

          </span>
          <p>
            The way you style your hair can also impact how your haircut looks.
            For a sleek, polished look, use a flat iron or blow dryer with a
            round brush. For a more relaxed, textured look, opt for a curling
            iron or texturizing spray.
