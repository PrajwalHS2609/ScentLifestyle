      <h5>What is Hair Botox?</h5>
      <p>
        Hair Botox is a non-chemical conditioning treatment designed to deeply
        nourish and repair hair from within. It doesn’t contain actual botulinum
        toxin (the ingredient in traditional Botox treatments) but instead uses
        a "botox-like" effect for hair—filling in damaged areas, smoothing
        cuticles, and giving hair a youthful, revitalized appearance. This
        treatment targets common hair problems like frizz, split ends, and lack
        of shine, and aims to improve overall hair health.
