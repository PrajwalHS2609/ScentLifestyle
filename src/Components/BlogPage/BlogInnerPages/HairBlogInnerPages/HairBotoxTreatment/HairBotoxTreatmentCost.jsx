      <h3>Cost of Hair Botox Treatment</h3>
      <p>
        Hair Botox treatment costs vary depending on factors like salon
        location, stylist expertise, and hair length. On average, prices can
        start at around ₹5,000 - ₹12,000 with some high-end salons charging
        more. While it might seem like an investment, the long-lasting effects
        make it worthwhile for many.
