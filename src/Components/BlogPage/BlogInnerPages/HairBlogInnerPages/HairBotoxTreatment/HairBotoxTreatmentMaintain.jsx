        Proper maintenance can help extend the life of your Hair Botox

            Use Sulfate-Free Shampoo:{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Sulfates can strip hair of moisture, so opt for a sulfate-free
            shampoo to maintain your treatmentâ€™s results.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>

            Limit Heat Styling:{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Too much heat can weaken your hair over time. When possible, let
            your hair air-dry or use a heat protectant if you must style it.
          </p>

           Deep Conditioning:{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Regular deep conditioning will help keep your hair hydrated and
            healthy, complementing the effects of your Hair Botox treatment.
