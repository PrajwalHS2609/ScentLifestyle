        </a>
        , though it can be more intensive. Here’s a breakdown of what you can
        expect:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6> 1. Initial Wash: </h6>
        <p>
          The stylist will first wash your hair to remove any dirt or product
          buildup. This prepares your hair to better absorb the Hair Botox
          treatment.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 2. Application:</h6>
        <p>
          The Hair Botox treatment is carefully applied to each strand, ensuring
          even coverage. It’s then left to sit for approximately 60-90 minutes
          to allow the ingredients to fully penetrate the hair shaft.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 3. Heat Activation:</h6>
        <p>
          Some salons use heat or steam to activate the ingredients, helping to
          infuse the nourishing compounds deeply into your hair.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>4. Drying and Straightening:</h6>
        <p>
          After the treatment has had time to work its magic, your stylist will
          rinse it out, dry your hair, and then straighten it. The heat from
          straightening seals the ingredients into your cuticles, providing a
          lasting effect.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>5. Final Look:</h6>
        <p>
          Once complete, you’ll have smooth, shiny, and healthy-looking hair
          that’s easy to manage and style.
        </p>
