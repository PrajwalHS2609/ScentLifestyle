      <h3>Hair Botox vs. Keratin Treatment</h3>
      <p>
        Both Hair Botox and keratin treatments are designed to smooth and
        improve hair texture, but there are some significant differences:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>Chemicals:</h6>
        <p>
           Keratin treatments often use formaldehyde or similar
          chemicals to lock in the smoothing effects, while Hair Botox is
          chemical-free.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Results:</h6>
        <p>
           Keratin treatments may produce a straighter look, while
          Hair Botox maintains natural volume and body.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> Process:</h6>
        <p>
          Keratin treatments can emit strong odors and fumes due to
          formaldehyde, while Hair Botox treatments are generally odor-free and
          more comfortable for sensitive individuals.
        </p>
      </li>
