      <h5>6. Chunky Highlights for a Retro Comeback ðŸŽ€</h5>
      <p>
        Taking inspiration from the early 2000s, chunky hair highlights are
        back! But this time, they come with a modern touch. Bold blonde streaks
        on dark hair or contrasting colors like copper on black create a
        striking look that turns heads.
