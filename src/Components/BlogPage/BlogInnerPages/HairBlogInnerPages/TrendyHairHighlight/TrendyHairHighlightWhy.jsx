        Hair highlights are one of the most versatile and stylish ways to change
        your look. They add depth, movement, and a touch of personality without
        requiring a full hair dye. Whether you opt for a subtle balayage or
        striking streaks, highlights can enhance your natural beauty and
        complement your facial features.
