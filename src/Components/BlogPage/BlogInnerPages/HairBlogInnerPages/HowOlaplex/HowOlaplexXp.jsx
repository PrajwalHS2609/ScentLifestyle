        Olaplex No.1 Bond Multiplier and No.2 Bond Perfector: The Salon
        Experience
      </h2>
      <p>
        Olaplex No.1 Bond Multiplier and No.2 Bond Perfector are the backbone of
        the Olaplex treatment system and are typically used in professional
        salons. During the coloring process, Olaplex No.1 is mixed with the
        color or bleach to protect the hair from damage. This step is crucial as
        it begins to rebuild the hairâ€™s broken bonds while the color is being
        processed.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the color has been rinsed out,
        <a href="https://scentlifestyle.com/shop"> Olaplex No.2</a> Bond
        Perfector is applied to the hair to further repair any remaining broken
        bonds, ensuring your hair remains strong, shiny, and healthy. Many
        clients at SCENT Salon have experienced dramatic improvements in their
        hair quality immediately after using these two products during their
        coloring sessions.
