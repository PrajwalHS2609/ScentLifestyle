      <h2>The Impact of Coloring on Hair Health</h2>
      <p>
        Coloring your hair, especially with bleach or permanent dyes, can cause
        significant damage. The chemicals used in these products break down the
        hairâ€™s natural structure to deposit color, which can lead to weakened
        hair bonds, dryness, and frizz. Over time, repeated coloring can result
        in dull, lifeless hair that is prone to breakage.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where Olaplex steps in as a savior. Unlike traditional
        conditioners or masks that only coat the surface of the hair, Olaplex
        works at the molecular level to restore and strengthen the hair from
        within.
