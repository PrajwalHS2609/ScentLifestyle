            Strengthens and Repairs Hair from Within:{" "}

          <p>
            Unlike other hair treatments that only coat the surface, Olaplex
            rebuilds broken bonds within the hair shaft, resulting in stronger,
            healthier hair.

            Protects Hair During and After Coloring:{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            By adding Olaplex No.1 to your hair color or bleach, you protect
            your hair from the damaging effects of these chemicals. Follow-up
            treatments with Olaplex No.2 further strengthen the hair after
            coloring.
