            Olaplex No.3 Hair Perfector: Your At-Home Repair Solution{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Olaplex No.3 Hair Perfector is the star of the Olaplex at-home
            range. This product is designed to be used once a week to strengthen
            and repair damaged hair. It helps maintain the results of your
            in-salon Olaplex treatment, ensuring that your hair remains healthy,
            shiny, and resilient. Applying No.3 to damp, towel-dried hair and
            leaving it on for at least 10 minutes (or longer for a more intense
            treatment) will provide you with a noticeable improvement in hair
            texture and strength.
