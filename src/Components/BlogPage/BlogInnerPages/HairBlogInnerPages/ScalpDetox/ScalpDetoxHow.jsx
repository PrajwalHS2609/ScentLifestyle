        the detoxification process. Scalp massages help stimulate blood
        circulation to the scalp, encouraging hair follicles to receive vital

        that the scalp receives the necessary oxygen and nutrients to stay
        healthy.

        during a detox can also help to reduce stress and tension, which are

        absorb these ingredients more effectively, but you also promote
        relaxation and wellness, both of which are vital for maintaining a
        healthy scalp.
