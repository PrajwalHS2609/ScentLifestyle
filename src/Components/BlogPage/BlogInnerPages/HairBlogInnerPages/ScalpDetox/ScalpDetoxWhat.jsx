      <h5>What is Scalp Detox?</h5>
      <p>
        A scalp detox is the process of cleansing your scalp to remove the
        buildup of product residues, oil, dead skin cells, and environmental
        pollutants. Over time, these impurities can clog your hair follicles,
        hinder proper hair growth, and lead to various scalp issues such as
        dandruff, itching, and irritation.{" "}
        <a href="https://scentlifestyle.com/scalp-detox-why-its-the-secret-to-gorgeous-hair">Scalp detox helps to eliminate these blockages</a>, creating
        an optimal environment for hair growth and overall hair health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much like a facial cleanse removes dirt and impurities from your skin, a
        scalp detox works to cleanse the scalp and restore balance, leaving it
        fresh, rejuvenated, and ready for healthy hair growth.
