        will depend on your scalp’s needs. For individuals with oily or
        product-heavy hair, a scalp detox every two weeks is ideal. If you have
        a dry or sensitive scalp, you may only need a detox once a month.
        Over-detoxifying the scalp can strip it of natural oils, so it’s
        important to find a balance that works best for your hair type.

        promoting healthy hair growth to reducing dandruff and irritation, a
        detoxified scalp is the secret to gorgeous, shiny hair.
