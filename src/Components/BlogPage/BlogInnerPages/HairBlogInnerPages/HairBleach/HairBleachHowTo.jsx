      </p>
      <li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>
              <img src={point} alt="point" />
              <p>
                {" "}
                Invest in a high-quality moisturizing shampoo and conditioner
                designed for color-treated or damaged hair.

            </span>

              <img src={point} alt="point" />
              <p>
                {" "}
                Use a deep conditioning treatment or hair mask at least once a
                week to replenish lost moisture.
              </p>
            </span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>2. Avoid Heat Styling</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>
              <img src={point} alt="point" />
              <p>
                {" "}
                Minimize the use of hot tools like curling irons, flat irons,
                and blow dryers. Heat can exacerbate dryness and breakage.
              </p>
            </span>

              <img src={point} alt="point" />{" "}
              <p>
                If you must use heat, apply a heat protectant spray beforehand.
              </p>
            </span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>3. Incorporate Protein Treatments</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>
              <img src={point} alt="point" />{" "}
              <p>
                Bleach breaks down the protein in your hair, so using a protein
                treatment can help rebuild strength.
              </p>
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>
              <img src={point} alt="point" />
              <p>
                {" "}
                Be cautious not to overdo it, as too much protein can make your
                hair stiff and brittle{" "}
              </p>
            </span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>4. Trim Split Ends</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>
              <img src={point} alt="point" />{" "}
              <p>
                Regular trims help remove damaged ends, preventing breakage from
                spreading further up the hair shaft.
