      <h5>Understanding Hair Bleaching</h5>
      <p>
        Hair bleaching involves a chemical process that strips your hair of its
        natural pigment. This is typically done using a mixture of bleach powder
        and developer. The developer contains hydrogen peroxide, which lifts the
        hair cuticle, allowing the bleach to penetrate and remove color.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the process is effective for lightening your hair, it also weakens
        its structural integrity. Bleaching can lead to dryness, breakage, and
        split ends if not managed properly. This is why the frequency of
        bleaching is such a critical factor.
