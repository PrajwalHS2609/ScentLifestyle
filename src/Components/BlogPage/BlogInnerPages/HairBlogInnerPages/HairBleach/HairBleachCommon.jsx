      <h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>

      <li>
        <h6>Bleaching Too Frequently:</h6>
        <p>
          Overlapping bleach on already lightened hair can lead to breakage.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Skipping Aftercare:</h6>
        <p>
          Neglecting your hairâ€™s recovery needs will make it prone to damage.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Using Harsh Products:</h6>
        <p>
          Avoid shampoos with sulfates or alcohol, as they can strip moisture.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Rushing the Process:</h6>
        <p>
          Trying to achieve your desired color in one session increases the risk
          of over-processing.

        being mindful of the signs your hair gives you.
