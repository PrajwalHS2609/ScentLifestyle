      <h5>How to Do a Shea Butter Hair Spa at Home</h5>
      <p>
        While visiting a professional salon for a Hair Spa is always a great
        option, you can also enjoy the benefits of a Shea Butter Hair Spa from
        the comfort of your home. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to achieving
        salon-like results:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <h4>Step 1: Gather Your Ingredients</h4>
        <p>To perform a Shea Butter Hair Spa at home, you will need:</p>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> Raw or organic Shea Butter{" "}
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> Coconut oil or olive oil{" "}
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> A mild shampoo and conditioner{" "}
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> A towel and shower cap{" "}
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h4>Step 2: Prepping the Hair</h4>
        <p>
          Before applying the treatment, wash your hair with a mild shampoo to
          remove dirt, oil, and product buildup. Towel dry your hair until it is
          damp but not soaking wet.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h4>Step 3: Applying the Shea Butter Mask</h4>
        <p>
          Melt a small amount of Shea Butter and mix it with a tablespoon of
          coconut or olive oil. Apply the mixture evenly throughout your hair,
          focusing on the mid-lengths and ends. Massage gently into the scalp to
          enhance blood circulation.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h4>Step 4: Steaming for Deeper Penetration</h4>
        <p>
          Wrap a warm towel around your head or wear a shower cap to allow the
          Shea Butter to penetrate deeply into your hair. Leave the treatment on
          for about 30-45 minutes to maximize its benefits.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h4>Step 5: Rinse and Condition</h4>
        <p>
          Rinse your hair thoroughly with lukewarm water and use a mild
          conditioner to lock in the moisture. Avoid using hot water as it can
          strip your hair of its natural oils.
        </p>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h4>Step 6: Enjoy the Results!</h4>
        <p>
          Once your hair is dry, you will notice the immediate softness and
          shine that a Shea Butter Hair Spa provides. With regular use, your
          hair will become stronger, healthier, and more resilient.
        </p>
