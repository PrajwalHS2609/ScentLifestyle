            Step 1:{" "}

          <p>
            Start by parting your hair down the middle. Take a section of hair
            from one side of your head and begin braiding it, working your way
            around your head like a crown.
          </p>

            <img src={point} alt="checked" />
            Step 2:
          </span>
          <p> Secure the end of the braid with a small elastic.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="checked" />
            Step 3:
          </span>
          <p> Repeat the process on the other side of your head. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="checked" />
            Step 4:
          </span>
          <p>
            Once both braids are done, pull them up and around the top of your
            head. Secure them with bobby pins, tucking in any loose ends.
          </p>

        <li>

            Step 5:{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Gently pull at the braids to create a fuller, more voluminous look.
            Finish with a light-hold hairspray.
