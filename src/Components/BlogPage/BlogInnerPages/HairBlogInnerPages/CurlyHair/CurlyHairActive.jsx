      <h5>6. How Active Is Your Lifestyle?</h5>
      <p>
        Curly hair requires a bit more attention, especially if you live an
        active lifestyle. Regular workouts, time outdoors, or daily exposure to
        humidity can impact how well curls hold up. If youâ€™re frequently on the
        go, consider if you have the time for refreshing and maintaining your
        curls regularly. Lightweight products and moisture-locking methods can
        help, but knowing the added care needed can help you make an informed
        decision.
