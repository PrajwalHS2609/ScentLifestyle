      <h3>Benefits Beyond Hair Growth</h3>
      <p>
        Even if the direct link between scalp massages and hair growth is still
        being studied, the benefits of this practice extend beyond just growing
        hair:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>Deep Nourishment and Hydration</h6>
        <p>
          Improved Scalp Health Regular massages can help reduce dandruff,
          itchiness, and dryness by distributing natural oils across the scalp
          and maintaining a healthy moisture balance.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Enhanced Product Absorption</h6>
        <p>
          If you use hair care treatments, massaging your scalp can help these
          products penetrate deeper, making them more effective.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Better Sleep</h6>
        <p>
          Scalp massages promote relaxation and can improve sleep quality, which
          indirectly supports overall hair health.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Relief from Tension</h6>
        <p>
          For those who suffer from headaches or tension in the scalp and neck
          area, massages can provide much-needed relief.
        </p>
      </li>
    </div>
