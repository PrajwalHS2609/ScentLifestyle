      <h5>How to Perform Scalp Massages for Hair Growth</h5>
      <p>
        For those eager to try scalp massages, the technique is critical. Hereâ€™s
        how to maximize the benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" />
            Use Your Fingertips{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Gently massage your scalp with your fingertips, applying light to
            moderate pressure. Avoid using nails to prevent scalp irritation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> Circular Motions
          </span>
          <p>
            Move your fingers in circular motions to stimulate blood flow
            effectively. Begin at the hairline and gradually work your way to
            the crown of your head.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> Incorporate Oils
          </span>
          <p>
            Using essential oils like rosemary, peppermint, or lavender can
            enhance the benefits of scalp massages. These oils are known for
            their nourishing and stimulating properties. Warm the oil slightly
            and massage it into your scalp for added relaxation and hydration.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" /> Consistency is Key
          </span>
          <p>
            Perform scalp massages daily or at least three to four times a week
            for noticeable results. Regularity plays a crucial role in promoting
            hair growth.
