      <h3>Scientific Evidence Supporting Scalp Massages</h3>
      <p>
        While there is limited research, some studies have suggested that
        regular scalp massages could indeed promote hair growth. For example:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>2016 Japanese Study</h6>
        <p>
          A small study conducted in Japan observed that participants who
          received a daily four-minute scalp massage over 24 weeks experienced
          an increase in hair thickness. Researchers attributed this to improved
          blood flow and stimulation of dermal papilla cells, which play a
          crucial role in hair growth.

        <h6>Stress Reduction and Hair Health</h6>
        <p>
          Stress is a significant cause of hair loss, particularly in conditions
          like telogen effluvium and alopecia areata. Scalp massages are known
          to reduce cortisol levels (the stress hormone) and promote relaxation,
          which can indirectly contribute to healthier hair.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Increased Sebum Production</h6>
        <p>
          Scalp massages may also stimulate the sebaceous glands, which produce
          sebumâ€”a natural oil that moisturizes the scalp and protects hair from
          becoming dry and brittle. Healthy sebum levels can prevent hair
          breakage, aiding in overall hair retention.
