        , other factors play a more significant role in determining hair growth:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>1. Diet and Nutrition</h6>
        <p>
          A balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals like biotin, vitamin D,
          zinc, and iron is essential for healthy hair growth.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>2. Hormonal Balance</h6>
        <p>
          Conditions like PCOS, thyroid disorders, or hormonal imbalances can
          significantly impact hair growth. Addressing these issues is vital.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 3. Genetics</h6>
        <p>
          Genetic predisposition largely determines hair thickness, growth
          patterns, and susceptibility to hair loss.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 4. Scalp Conditions</h6>
        <p>
          Scalp issues such as psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, or fungal
          infections can hinder hair growth. Treating these conditions is
          crucial for optimal results.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 5. Hair Care Practices</h6>
        <p>
          Overuse of heat styling tools, chemical treatments, and harsh shampoos
          can damage hair and impede growth. A gentle, nourishing hair care
          routine is key.
