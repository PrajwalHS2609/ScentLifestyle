      <h3>Myths About Scalp Massages and Hair Growth</h3>
      <p>
        Despite their benefits, it’s important to debunk some common
        misconceptions about scalp massages:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>Instant Results</h6>
        <p>
          Hair growth is a slow process, averaging about half an inch per month.
          Don’t expect overnight results from scalp massages. Patience and
          consistency are necessary.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Massaging Harder is Better</h6>
        <p>
          Applying excessive pressure won’t enhance hair growth and may even
          irritate your scalp. Gentle, consistent massages are far more
          effective.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>They Work for Everyone</h6>
        <p>
          While scalp massages can improve blood flow and relaxation, they may
          not work equally for everyone. Individual results depend on various
          factors, including overall health, age, and genetic predisposition.
