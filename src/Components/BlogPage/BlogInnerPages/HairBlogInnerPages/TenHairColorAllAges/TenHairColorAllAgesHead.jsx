      <li>
        <h6>1. Soft Balayage </h6>
        <p>
          Balayage remains one of the most universally flattering and
          age-defying hair color techniques. This French-inspired method of
          hand-painting highlights offers a sun-kissed, natural appearance. It's
          low maintenance, perfect for all hair lengths, and grows out
          gracefully—making it ideal for women of any age looking for effortless
          beauty. Whether you’re 20 or 60, a soft balayage in caramel, honey, or
          ash tones adds dimension and radiance to your locks.

        <h6>2. Classic Chocolate Brown </h6>
        <p>
          Rich, glossy chocolate brown never goes out of style. It suits most
          skin tones, adds depth to the hair, and can make fine hair appear
          thicker.{" "}

            Chocolate brown can be the base color
          </a>{" "}
          for those wanting to play with highlights later or left as a
          sophisticated standalone shade. For older women, it brings warmth and
          vibrancy without being too loud.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>3. Icy Blonde </h6>
        <p>
          For women seeking a bold yet elegant statement, icy blonde is the way
          to go. This color exudes cool sophistication and works well with short
          bobs, pixie cuts, and long layered hair. While maintenance can be
          higher, toners and purple shampoos help keep brassiness at bay. Icy
          blonde is especially striking for women with cooler undertones and
          pairs beautifully with modern cuts.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>4. Rose Gold Elegance </h6>
        <p>
          Looking to add a bit of playful femininity to your hair? Rose gold is
          a perfect balance between soft pink and warm blonde. This trend has
          seen a surge in popularity among women of all ages because of its
          gentle pastel hue that offers both elegance and a touch of edginess.
          Younger women can go full rose gold, while older women can opt for
          rose-tinted highlights to subtly enhance their base shade.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>5. Silver or Platinum Gray </h6>
        <p>
          Gray is no longer seen as something to hide—it's a fashion statement!
          Many women are embracing their natural grays, enhancing them with
          silver or platinum hues for a polished and chic finish. Whether you’re
          transitioning into gray or want to try this trendy shade from scratch,
          a silver/platinum color oozes confidence and modern style. It’s sleek,
          edgy, and dignified all at once.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>6. Warm Auburn </h6>
        <p>
          If you're looking for a warm and rich hue, auburn is a timeless
          choice. This blend of red and brown offers a striking contrast that
          flatters fair to medium complexions. Auburn is youthful without being
          too dramatic, and it shines beautifully in sunlight. It’s a perfect
          seasonal transition shade and works exceptionally well for women in
          their 30s to 50s who want a pop of color without going too bright.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>7. Ash Blonde with Shadow Root </h6>
        <p>
          Ash blonde with a shadow root is an ideal mix of trendy and practical.
          The darker root helps with regrowth, reducing the need for constant
          touch-ups, while the cool ash tones are very flattering. It’s great
          for women who want to lighten their hair without fully committing to
          bleach blonde. This color technique adds depth and dimension and works
          well on both straight and wavy hair.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 8. Deep Burgundy</h6>
        <p>
          Deep burgundy is rich, elegant, and adds a layer of mystery to your
          style. It works beautifully on medium to dark skin tones and is an
          excellent choice for women looking to venture into red hues with a
          mature twist. Whether it’s an all-over color or just lowlights,
          burgundy can dramatically transform your look while maintaining a
          level of subtlety and sophistication.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>9. Face-Framing Highlights </h6>
        <p>
          Face-framing highlights are a fantastic way to brighten up your face
          and add a youthful glow without committing to a full color change.
          This technique can be customized in any shade—caramel, blonde, mocha,
          or even pastel—depending on your base color and skin tone. It’s a
          flattering, age-inclusive option that draws attention to your best
          facial features and works well with layered or textured hairstyles.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>10. Golden Honey Tones </h6>
        <p>
          Golden honey tones are flattering across the board, adding softness
          and warmth to your hair. These hues can range from light honey blonde
          to deep honey brown, making them adaptable for both lighter and darker
          bases. The glow from these colors brightens your complexion and adds
          life to dull or tired hair. It’s a go-to for women who want something
          natural but still noticeable.
