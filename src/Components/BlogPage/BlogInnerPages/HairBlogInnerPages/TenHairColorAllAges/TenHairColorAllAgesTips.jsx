      <h5>Tips for Choosing the Right Hair Color for Your Age and Style</h5>
      <p>

        all ages, here are a few essential tips to help you choose what works
        best for you:

            Consider Your Skin Tone:{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Cool-toned skin pairs well with ash, platinum, and icy colors, while
            warm-toned skin glows with honey, auburn, and golden hues.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" />
            Think About Maintenance:{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Some colors like platinum blonde or vivid reds require regular
            touch-ups. If you're someone with a busy lifestyle, consider options
            like balayage, shadow roots, or subtle highlights.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" />
            Embrace Natural Transitions:{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            If you're graying naturally, consider working with it instead of
            against it. Silver, gray balayage, or platinum blends can turn your
            natural gray into a fashion-forward statement.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" />
            Match with Your Lifestyle:{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            {" "}
            Are you in a corporate job? Maybe something more subtle like
            chocolate brown or soft caramel highlights would suit better.
            Creative field? You could experiment with bolder shades like rose
            gold or burgundy.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" />
            Consult a Color Specialist:{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            {" "}
            A professional hair colorist can assess your hairâ€™s condition,
            texture, and history to recommend what will work best for your needs
            and desires.
