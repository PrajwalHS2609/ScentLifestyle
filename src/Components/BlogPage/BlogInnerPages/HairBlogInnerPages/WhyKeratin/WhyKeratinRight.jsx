          <p>
            Keratin treatment works best for people with damaged or frizzy hair.
            If your hair is healthy and doesn’t require smoothing, you may not
            see as dramatic a transformation.

          <p>
            After getting a keratin treatment, you’ll need to use sulfate-free
            shampoos and conditioners to preserve the treatment’s effects. You
            should also limit your exposure to saltwater and chlorine, which can
            wear away the keratin layer faster.
          </p>

          <p>
            Keratin treatments should be done by a professional stylist to
            ensure that the product is applied correctly and that the right type
            of treatment is chosen for your hair.
