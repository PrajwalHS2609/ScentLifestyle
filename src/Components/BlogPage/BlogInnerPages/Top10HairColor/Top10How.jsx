      <h3>How to Care for Your New Hair Colour and Highlights</h3>
      <p>
        Once you've chosen your new hair color or highlights, it's essential to
        care for your hair to maintain its vibrancy and health. Here are some
        tips for keeping your hair looking its best:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>Use Color-Safe Products:</h6> Invest in high-quality, color-safe
        shampoos and conditioners to protect your hair color from fading. Avoid
        products that contain sulfates, as they can strip the color from your
        hair.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> Avoid Heat Styling:</h6> Excessive heat styling can damage your
        hair and cause your color to fade. If you must use heat tools, be sure
        to use a heat protectant spray to minimize damage.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Limit Sun Exposure:</h6> The sun's UV rays can cause your hair color
        to fade. Protect your hair by wearing a hat or using UV-protective hair
        products when spending time outdoors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> Stay Hydrated:</h6> Healthy hair starts from within. Drink plenty
        of water and eat a balanced diet to keep your hair hydrated and
        nourished.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Regular Touch-Ups: </h6> Depending on your chosen color and style,
        you may need regular touch-ups to maintain your look. Consult with your
        stylist at SCENT to determine the best schedule for touch-ups.
      </li>
