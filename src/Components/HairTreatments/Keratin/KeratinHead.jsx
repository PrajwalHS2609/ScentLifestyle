      <h2>What is Keratin Hair Treatment?</h2>
      <p>
        Keratin is a protein that naturally occurs in your hair, skin, and
        nails. Over time, due to exposure to harsh environmental elements,
        chemical treatments, and heat styling, the natural keratin in your hair
        can become depleted. This leads to dry, frizzy, and damaged hair.

          Keratin hair treatment in Bangalore
        </a>{" "}
        involves applying a keratin-infused solution to your hair, which is then
        sealed in with the heat of a flat iron. The result is smoother, shinier,
        and healthier-looking hair.
