        is a straightforward process, but it requires the expertise of a trained
        stylist to ensure the best results. Here's what you can expect during
        your treatment:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>1. Consultation:</h6> Your stylist will begin with a consultation to
        assess your hair type and discuss your desired results. This is the time
        to talk about any concerns you may have and ask questions about the
        keratin hair treatment in Bangalore.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>2. Hair Cleansing:</h6> The treatment begins with a thorough
        cleansing of your hair to remove any dirt, oil, and product buildup.
        This step is crucial as it prepares your hair to absorb the keratin
        treatment effectively.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>3. Application of Keratin Solution:</h6> Once your hair is clean and
        slightly damp, the keratin solution is applied evenly throughout your
        hair. Your stylist will ensure that every strand is coated with the
        treatment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 4. Heat Activation:</h6> After the keratin solution has been
        applied, your hair is blow-dried and then flat-ironed to seal the
        keratin into the hair cuticle. This step is critical as it locks in the
        treatment, ensuring long-lasting results.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>5. Final Rinse and Blow-Dry:</h6> After the treatment has set, your
        hair is rinsed to remove any excess product, followed by another
        blow-dry. Your hair will now be smooth, shiny, and ready to show off.
      </li>
