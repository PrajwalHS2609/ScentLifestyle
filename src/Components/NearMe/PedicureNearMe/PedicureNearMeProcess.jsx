      <li>
        <h6>1. Consultation</h6>
        <p>
          We begin by understanding your needs and preferences to customize the
          experience.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>2. Soaking</h6>
        <p>
          Your feet are soaked in a warm, aromatic bath to soften the skin and
          relax the muscles.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 3. Exfoliation</h6>
        <p>
          Dead skin cells are gently removed using a scrub tailored to your skin
          type.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 4. Nail Care</h6>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 5. Massage</h6>
        <p>
          A soothing foot massage enhances blood circulation and leaves you
          feeling rejuvenated.
