        <p>
          Highlights and lowlights are a fantastic way to add dimension to your
          hair without changing your overall color. Highlights can brighten up
          your look by lightening specific strands of hair, while lowlights add
          depth by incorporating darker tones. If you’re interested in achieving
          a multi-dimensional look, SCENT’s hair color services near me are
          perfect for you.

        <h6>3. Balayage</h6>
        <p>
          Balayage is one of the most popular hair coloring techniques and for
          good reason. This freehand technique creates soft, natural-looking
          highlights that blend seamlessly with your hair’s natural color.
