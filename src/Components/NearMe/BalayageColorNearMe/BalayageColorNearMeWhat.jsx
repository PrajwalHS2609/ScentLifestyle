        , let’s talk about what balayage is and why it’s so beloved. Derived
        from the French word meaning “to sweep” or “to paint,” balayage is a
        hair coloring technique that involves hand-painting highlights onto the
        hair’s surface. This creates a more natural, blended effect compared to
        traditional foil highlights, mimicking the gradual lightening of hair by
        the sun.
