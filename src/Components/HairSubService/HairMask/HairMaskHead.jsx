      <h3>Why Hair Masks Are Essential for Hair Care</h3>
      <p>
        Hair masks are not just an indulgence but a necessity for maintaining
        healthy, lustrous hair. Unlike regular conditioners, hair masks
        penetrate deep into the hair shaft, delivering intensive hydration and
        essential nutrients. They address a variety of hair concerns, including
        dryness, damage, frizz, and breakage, making them an indispensable part
        of any hair care routine.
