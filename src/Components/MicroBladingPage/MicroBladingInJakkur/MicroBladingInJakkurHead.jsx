      <h2>What is Eyebrow Microblading?</h2>
      <p>
        Eyebrow Microblading in Jakkur is a form of semi-permanent tattooing
        that uses a specialized tool to create fine, hair-like strokes on the
        skin. These strokes mimic the natural growth pattern of eyebrow hairs,
        giving you the appearance of fuller, well-shaped brows. Unlike
        traditional tattoos, microblading uses pigment rather than ink, and the
        results are designed to fade over time, usually lasting between 12 to 18
        months. This makes{" "}

        long-term commitment.
