        <h6>1. Consultation: </h6>
        <p>
          Your journey begins with a consultation where we discuss your desired
          brow shape, thickness, and color. We’ll map out your new brows with a

      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>2. Numbing:</h6>
        <p>
          To ensure your comfort during the microblading process, we apply a
          numbing cream to the brow area. This helps to minimize any discomfort
          and allows you to relax while our technician performs the Eyebrow
          Microblading in JP Nagar.

      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>3. Microblading: </h6>
        <p>
          Using a handheld microblading tool, our technician will carefully
          create fine, hair-like strokes in the brow area. The pigment is
          deposited into the superficial layers of the skin, creating a
          natural-looking brow that blends seamlessly with your existing hairs.
          This step is performed with precision to achieve the desired shape and
          fullness through Eyebrow Microblading in JP Nagar.
        </p>

        <h6>4. Aftercare:</h6>
        <p>
          After your Eyebrow Microblading in JP Nagar session, you’ll be given
          detailed aftercare instructions to ensure proper healing. This
          includes keeping the area clean, avoiding certain activities that may
          cause the pigment to fade prematurely, and using any recommended
          products to maintain the results.
