        aftercare instructions provided by our Eyebrow Microblading in JP Nagar
        experts. Here are a few tips:

          <p>
            Sun exposure can cause the pigment to fade more quickly. Use
            sunscreen or wear a hat to protect your brows.

          <p>
            The healing process is crucial for the best results. Avoid touching
            your brows, and follow any recommended aftercare steps to ensure
            proper healing after your Eyebrow Microblading in JP Nagar session.

            Schedule Touch-Ups:{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Depending on your skin type and how well the pigment holds, you may
            need to schedule touch-up sessions every 12 to 18 months. This helps
            to maintain the shape and color of your brows through Eyebrow
            Microblading in JP Nagar.
