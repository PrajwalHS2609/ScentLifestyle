        is so popular, let's first understand what microblading actually is.
        Microblading is a semi-permanent cosmetic procedure that involves using
        a handheld tool to deposit pigment into the skin. Unlike traditional
        tattooing, microblading mimics the appearance of real hair by creating
        fine, hair-like strokes on the eyebrow area. This makes it perfect for
        those who have thin, sparse, or uneven brows.
