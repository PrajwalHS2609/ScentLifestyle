        <h3>What is Eyebrow Microblading?</h3>
        <p>
          Before diving into the reasons why SCENT is the leading salon for
          <a href="https://scentlifestyle.com/eyebrow-microblading">
            Eyebrow Microblading in Uptown Whitefield
          </a>
          , it’s important to understand what this technique involves. Eyebrow
          microblading is a form of semi-permanent makeup where tiny, hair-like
          strokes are manually applied using a blade made of fine needles. These
          strokes mimic natural eyebrow hairs and are filled with pigment to
          create fuller, well-defined brows that look completely natural.

          At SCENT, our artists have mastered the art of{" "}

          </a>
          , ensuring that each client’s results are long-lasting, subtle, and
          tailored to their individual preferences. The pigment used in
          microblading is semi-permanent, meaning it fades gradually over time,
          and touch-ups are recommended every 12-18 months to maintain the shape
          and color of your brows.
