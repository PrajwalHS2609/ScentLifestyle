            time to map out the perfect brow shape for you, ensuring that the
            results enhance your natural features. During your consultation,
            we’ll discuss your ideal eyebrow shape and thickness to create a
            look that’s specifically designed for you.

            One of the major benefits of choosing Eyebrow Microblading in Uptown
            Whitefield at SCENT is the long-lasting results. After your initial
            session, you can expect beautifully defined eyebrows for up to 18
            months with proper care. Unlike traditional eyebrow makeup that can
            smudge or fade throughout the day, microblading provides
            semi-permanent results that allow you to wake up with perfect brows
            every morning.
