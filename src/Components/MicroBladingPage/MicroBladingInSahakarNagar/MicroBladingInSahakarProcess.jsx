      <h3>The Eyebrow Microblading Process at SCENT</h3>
      <p>
        At SCENT, we strive to make the Eyebrow Microblading in Sahakara Nagar
        experience as smooth and enjoyable as possible. Here’s what you can
        expect during your microblading session at our salon:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>1. Consultation and Brow Design</h6>
        <p>
          Your microblading journey begins with a detailed consultation, during
          which our technician will assess your natural brows and discuss your
          desired look. We’ll take into consideration your face shape, skin
          tone, and personal preferences to design the perfect brow shape for
          you. Our goal is to create a look that enhances your natural beauty
          while ensuring that your brows look full, symmetrical, and
          well-defined.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>2. Numbing the Area</h6>
        <p>
          Before the microblading process begins, we’ll apply a topical numbing
          cream to the brow area to minimize any discomfort during the
          procedure. This ensures that the process is as pain-free as possible,
          allowing you to relax and enjoy the experience.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>3. Microblading Application</h6>
        <p>
          Once the numbing cream has taken effect, our technician will begin the
          microblading process. Using a handheld tool with tiny, precise
          needles, we’ll create hair-like strokes in the brow area to mimic the
          appearance of natural eyebrow hairs. The pigment is applied with each
          stroke, gradually filling in your brows and giving them a fuller, more
          defined look.
        </p>
