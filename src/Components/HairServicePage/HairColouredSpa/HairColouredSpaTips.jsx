      <h5>Maintenance Tips for Colored Hair Between Spa Treatments</h5>
      <p>
        To keep your hair looking vibrant between visits to our Hair Spa for
        Colored Hair in Bangalore, here are some expert tips:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" />
            Use Color-Safe Shampoos and Conditioners{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Stick to products specifically designed for color-treated hair to
            prevent fading and protect vibrancy.
          </p>
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" />
            Limit Washing Frequency{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Washing too frequently can strip your color. Try to wash your hair
            only two to three times a week and use dry shampoo as needed.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" />
            Avoid Excessive Heat Styling{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Heat styling can cause color to fade faster and lead to dryness.
            When using heat, always apply a heat protectant and keep the
            temperature as low as possible.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={point} alt="point" />
            Protect Hair from Sun Exposure{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            UV rays can fade color-treated hair. If youâ€™re spending time
            outdoors, wear a hat or use a UV-protectant spray to shield your
            hair.
          </p>
        </li>{" "}
        <li>
