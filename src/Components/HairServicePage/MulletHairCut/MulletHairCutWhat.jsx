      <h5>What is the Modern Mullet Haircut?</h5>
      <p>
        The Modern Mullet Haircut for Women in Bangalore is a contemporary
        interpretation of the classic mullet that was popularized in the 1980s.
        Unlike its predecessor, which was often characterized by a stark
        contrast between the shorter front and longer back, the modern mullet
        features softer lines and more blended layers. It allows for
        versatility, enabling women to choose how bold or subtle they want their
        look to be. This{" "}

        typically has shorter layers at the front and longer layers at the back,
        creating an edgy yet elegant style that flatters a variety of face
        shapes and hair types.
