      <h3>The Process of Our Hair Anti-Dandruff Spa Treatment</h3>
      <p>
        SCENT’s hair anti-dandruff spa in Bangalore follows a systematic
        approach designed to treat dandruff at its root while pampering your
        scalp and hair. Here’s what you can expect during our anti-dandruff spa
        treatment:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>1. Initial Consultation and Scalp Analysis </h6>
        <p>
          Our anti-dandruff
          specialists conduct a thorough scalp analysis to understand the
          severity of dandruff and assess your scalp’s condition. This helps us
          tailor the anti-dandruff treatment specifically for you, so you
          receive maximum benefit.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 2. Gentle Cleansing and Scalp Exfoliation</h6>
        <p>
          The treatment begins with a
          gentle scalp cleanse using specialized anti-dandruff shampoos that
          remove impurities, oil buildup, and dead skin cells. This step sets
          the foundation for our anti-dandruff treatment by deeply cleansing
          your scalp.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 3. Application of Anti-Dandruff Hair Mask </h6>
        <p>
          The application of a
          specialized anti-dandruff hair mask is the core of the treatment. Our
          mask is packed with ingredients that actively target dandruff, such as
          tea tree oil, salicylic acid, and other natural extracts. These
          ingredients penetrate the scalp, providing relief from itchiness while
          nourishing and moisturizing your scalp.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>   4. Steam Therapy for Better Absorption</h6>
        <p>
        Steam therapy helps the mask
          ingredients penetrate deeper into the scalp, amplifying the
          effectiveness of our anti-dandruff treatment salon. This not only
          eliminates dandruff but also provides a relaxing, spa-like experience.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 5. Massage for Improved Circulation</h6>
        <p>
           A soothing head massage follows
          the steam therapy. Our skilled therapists use targeted techniques to
          increase blood circulation, which helps deliver nutrients to the hair
          follicles. This step also boosts relaxation, making it one of the most
          enjoyable parts of the treatment.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>6. Rinse and Hydrating Conditioner</h6>
        <p>
           The anti-dandruff mask is then
          rinsed off, and a hydrating conditioner is applied to lock in
          moisture. This ensures that your hair remains soft, smooth, and free
          from flakes, preventing the recurrence of dandruff.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>7. Aftercare Advice</h6>
        <p>
           Post-treatment, our specialists will provide you
          with personalized aftercare advice. This includes tips on maintaining
          scalp hygiene, using anti-dandruff products, and incorporating other
          healthy habits into your routine to prevent dandruff from coming back.
