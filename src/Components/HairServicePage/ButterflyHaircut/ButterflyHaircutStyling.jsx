      <h5>Styling Tips for the Butterfly Hair Cut</h5>
      <p>
        At SCENT Salon, we believe that the right styling techniques can make
        all the difference in how your Butterfly Hair Cut looks. Here are some
        tips to help you style your hair and make the most of your new haircut:

            Use the Right Products:
          </span>
          <p>
            Invest in high-quality hair care products that suit your hair type.
            A volumizing mousse or spray can enhance the layers and create the
            illusion of fullness. For those with curly hair, a curl-defining
            cream can help maintain your natural texture while adding definition
            to your curls.

            Blow-Dry with a Round Brush:
          </span>
          <p>
            For a polished look, use a round brush while blow-drying your hair.
            This technique can help create volume at the roots and enhance the
            shape of the layers. Remember to direct the airflow downwards to
            minimize frizz and promote shine.
          </p>

        <li>

            Try Loose Waves:{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            If you want a more relaxed look, consider adding loose waves to your
            hair. Use a curling wand or a flat iron to create soft waves that
            accentuate the layers. This effortless style is perfect for casual
            outings and adds a touch of elegance to your overall appearance.
          </p>

        <li>

            <img src={point} alt="point" />
            Experiment with Parting{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            The way you part your hair can significantly impact your overall
            look. Try different parting styles—middle, side, or even a deep side
            part—to see which one flatters your face shape the most. Changing
            your part can instantly refresh your hairstyle and give you a new
            vibe.

            Regular Trims{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            To maintain the shape and health of your Butterfly Hair Cut, regular
            trims are essential. Schedule appointments at SCENT Salon every 6-8
            weeks to keep your layers looking fresh and prevent split ends.
