      <h3>What to Expect During Your Hair Spa for Colored Hair at SCENT</h3>
      <p>
        At SCENT, we understand the unique needs of colored hair, and our
        experts have perfected the hair spa process to give your hair the
        pampering it deserves. Here’s what you can expect:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6> Personalized Consultation</h6>
        <p>
          Our experts start with a one-on-one consultation to understand your
          hair type, color treatment history, and specific concerns. This helps
          us tailor the Hair Spa for Colored Hair in Bangalore to your unique
          needs, ensuring you get the maximum benefits.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> Gentle, Color-Safe Shampooing</h6>
        <p>
          The spa experience begins with a color-safe shampoo that gently
          cleanses your hair and scalp without stripping away essential oils or
          fading your color. Our sulfate-free shampoos are formulated to be
          gentle on color-treated hair, preserving vibrancy.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Deep Conditioning Treatment</h6>
        <p>
          Next, we apply a nutrient-rich deep conditioning mask specifically
          designed for colored hair. This mask penetrates deeply into each
          strand, infusing your hair with hydration, vitamins, and essential
          oils to strengthen, soften, and add radiance.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> Relaxing Scalp Massage</h6>
        <p>
          A relaxing scalp massage is a vital part of our hair spa experience.
          This massage improves blood circulation, promoting healthy hair growth
          and enhancing relaxation. It also helps the conditioner absorb deeply,
          ensuring maximum effectiveness.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> Heat Therapy for Optimal Absorption</h6>
        <p>
          For the conditioning treatment to penetrate fully, we use a gentle
          heat process. This opens up the hair cuticles, allowing nutrients to
          reach the innermost layers of your hair. This step is crucial for
          maintaining healthy, hydrated hair after a coloring process.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> Rinse and Style</h6>
        <p>
          After the treatment, we rinse your hair with cool water to seal in the
          conditioning benefits. Finally, our experts style your hair to your
          liking, providing you with a refreshed look that’s vibrant, shiny, and
          healthy.
        </p>
