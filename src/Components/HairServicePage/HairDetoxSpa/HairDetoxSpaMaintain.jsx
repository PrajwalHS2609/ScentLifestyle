      <h5>Maintenance Tips for Detoxed Hair</h5>
      <p>
        The Hair Hydration Boost Spa experience at SCENT offers numerous
        benefits, transforming hair from the inside out. Here are some of the
        reasons why clients return to us for their moisture needs:

            Use Gentle, Sulfate-Free Shampoos{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Sulfate-free shampoos are gentle on your hair and scalp, preventing
            excessive dryness and maintaining the effects of the detox.

            Avoid Overusing Styling Products{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Try to limit the use of heavy styling products that can cause
            buildup. Opt for lighter, natural alternatives when possible.

            Reduced Breakage and Split Ends:{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Properly moisturized hair is more resilient, meaning less breakage
            and fewer split ends. This helps you maintain length and fullness,
            which is especially important for those growing their hair out.
          </p>

        <li>

            Regularly Brush Your Hair{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Brushing helps distribute natural oils and keeps your scalp healthy
            by stimulating circulation.

            Protect Hair from Environmental Stressors{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Pollution and sun exposure can harm your hair. Use a hat or scarf to
            shield your hair from direct sunlight and environmental pollutants.
