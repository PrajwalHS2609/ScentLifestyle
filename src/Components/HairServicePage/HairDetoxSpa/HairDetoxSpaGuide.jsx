      <h3>Step-by-Step Guide to Our Hair Detox Spa Treatment in Bangalore</h3>
      <p>
        When you choose SCENT’s Hair Detox Spa in Bangalore, you’re opting for a
        thorough and transformative treatment. Here’s a breakdown of our
        step-by-step process:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>1. Scalp Assessment and Consultation</h6>
        <p>
          Your treatment begins with a detailed scalp and hair assessment. Our
          specialists identify any buildup, dryness, or sensitivity and discuss
          your hair goals with you. This consultation helps us customize the
          detox treatment to your specific needs.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>2. Deep Cleansing with Detox Shampoo</h6>
        <p>
          We start the detox process with a specially formulated detox shampoo
          that effectively lifts away impurities from the scalp and hair. This
          step ensures that all surface dirt, oils, and product residue are
          gently but thoroughly removed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>3. Exfoliating Scalp Treatment</h6>
        <p>
          Using a gentle exfoliant, our specialists work on your scalp to remove
          dead skin cells and unclog hair follicles. This exfoliating process
          allows the scalp to breathe and helps stimulate blood flow, which
          supports healthy hair growth.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>4. Nourishing Detox Mask</h6>
        <p>
          Next, we apply a nutrient-rich detox mask that penetrates deeply into
          the hair shaft and scalp, delivering essential vitamins, minerals, and
          hydration. This mask not only nourishes your hair but also fortifies
          it, reducing brittleness and boosting resilience.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>5. Hydrating and Strengthening Conditioner</h6>
        <p>
          Our experts apply a conditioning treatment that locks in moisture,
          seals the hair cuticles, and adds strength. This helps restore
          softness and manageability, making your hair look and feel
          revitalized.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>6. Relaxing Scalp Massage</h6>
        <p>
          A soothing scalp massage is a key part of our detox spa experience. It
          helps stimulate blood circulation, promote relaxation, and ensure that
          nutrients are fully absorbed into your scalp.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>7. Rinse and Style</h6>
        <p>
          o We finish the treatment with a refreshing rinse and style your hair
          according to your preferences. Our stylists provide tips on
          maintaining your detoxed hair and recommend products that will help
          prolong the results.
