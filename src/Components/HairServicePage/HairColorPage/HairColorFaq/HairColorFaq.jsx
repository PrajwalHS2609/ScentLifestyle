          <span>What is balayage hair colour?</span>
          <p>
            Balayage hair colour is a technique where highlights are applied to
            the hair to create a natural, graduated effect. It differs from
            traditional foil highlighting as it allows for a more seamless blend
            and softer regrowth lines. It's known for creating a sun-kissed,
            natural look with less maintenance compared to other techniques.

            <li>
              Deep Conditioning Treatments: Treat your hair to regular deep
              conditioning treatments to keep it hydrated and healthy like the
              Hair Botox One-Day treatment or the Olaplex hair spa at SCENT.
            </li>
            <li>
              Limit Washing: Washing hair less frequently can help preserve
              colour. When you do wash, use cool water to avoid stripping the
              colour.

          <span>Is hair colour permanent?</span>
          <p>
            Hair colour can be permanent or temporary, depending on the type of
            dye used. Permanent hair colour penetrates the hair shaft and lasts
            until the hair grows out or is cut.
