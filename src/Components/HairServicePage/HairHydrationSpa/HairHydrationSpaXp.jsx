      <h3>Step-by-Step Experience of SCENT’s Hair Hydration Boost Spa</h3>
      <p>
        Wondering what to expect from your Hair Hydration Boost Spa in Bangalore
        experience? Here’s a look at our spa process:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6> 1. Consultation:</h6>
        <p>
          We begin with a detailed consultation to assess your hair’s unique
          needs. Whether you’re a man seeking hydration for coarser hair or a
          woman wanting smooth, sleek strands, we ensure the treatment is
          tailored to your hair type.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>2. Deep Cleansing:</h6>
        <p>
           To prepare your hair for maximum moisture
          absorption, we start with a deep cleanse, removing any buildup or
          impurities.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 3. Moisturizing Treatment Application:</h6>
        <p>
          Our stylists then apply a rich
          blend of the best moisturizers for dry hair. These products are
          massaged into your hair and scalp, ensuring deep penetration of
          nutrients.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 4. Relaxation Period:</h6>
        <p>
           We allow the moisturizing treatment to sit on
          your hair, giving it time to work its magic. During this time, you can
          unwind, enjoy a soothing scalp massage, and feel the tension melt
          away.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>  5. Rinse and Style:</h6>
        <p>
          Once the treatment is complete, we rinse your hair
          with lukewarm water to lock in moisture. Your hair is then gently
          dried and styled, leaving you with a refreshed look and silky-smooth
          hair.
        </p>
      </li>
