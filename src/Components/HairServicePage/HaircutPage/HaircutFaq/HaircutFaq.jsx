          <span>How can I determine my face shape for a haircut?</span>
          <p>
            To identify your face shape for a haircut, measure your forehead,
            cheekbones, jawline, and face length. Based on these measurements,
            you can determine if your face shape is round, square, oval,
            heart-shaped, or diamond-shaped.
