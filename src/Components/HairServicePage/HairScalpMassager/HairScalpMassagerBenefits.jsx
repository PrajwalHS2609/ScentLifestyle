      <h3>Benefits of Scalp Massage</h3>
      <li>
        <h6>Stress Relief:</h6>
        <p>
          Scalp massages are known to reduce stress by stimulating pressure
          points on your head. This releases tension, eases anxiety, and fosters
          a sense of calmness.{" "}
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Improved Blood Circulation:</h6>
        <p>
          Gentle yet firm strokes during a scalp massage help improve blood flow
          to the scalp and hair follicles, ensuring better nutrient and oxygen
          delivery.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Promotes Hair Health:</h6>
        <p>
          Regular scalp massages can enhance hair growth by stimulating hair
          follicles, reducing dandruff, and improving overall scalp condition.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> Pain and Headache Relief:</h6>
        <p>
          If you suffer from tension headaches or migraines, a scalp massage can
          be a natural way to alleviate the discomfort by relaxing the muscles
          and reducing pressure.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> Improved Sleep:</h6>
        <p>
          The relaxing nature of scalp massages promotes better sleep quality,
          making it an ideal solution for those dealing with insomnia or
          irregular sleep patterns.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> Boosted Mood:</h6>
        <p>
          Massages trigger the release of endorphins, the body’s natural
          “feel-good” hormones, helping improve mood and reduce irritability.
        </p>
