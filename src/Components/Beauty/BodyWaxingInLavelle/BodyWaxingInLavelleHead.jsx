        Body Waxing, Threading & D-Tan in Lavelle Road at SCENT isn't just about
        hair removal; it's about giving your skin the care it deserves. Waxing
        is one of the most effective methods for long-lasting hair removal,
        leaving your skin hair-free for weeks. Unlike shaving, which can cause
        irritation and cuts, waxing removes hair from the root, which can lead
        to finer and sparser regrowth over time. Our Body Waxing, Threading &
        D-Tan in Lavelle Road services are designed to cater to your specific
        needs, whether you have coarse hair or sensitive skin.

        offerings, is a centuries-old technique that provides precise hair
        removal, particularly for facial areas. This method is ideal for shaping
        eyebrows and removing fine hair without the use of chemicals. At SCENT
        Hair & Beauty Salon, our threading experts ensure that your eyebrows are
        perfectly shaped to complement your facial features. Threading is gentle
        on the skin and is a great option for those who may have reactions to
        waxing or other hair removal methods.
