        , waxing is often the first step in achieving smooth arms. Hereâ€™s why
        waxing is a preferred choice:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>Long-lasting Smoothness :</h6>Unlike shaving, waxing removes hair
        from the root, resulting in smoother skin for a longer period, usually
        up to four weeks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Reduced Hair Growth :</h6> With regular waxing, hair growth becomes
        finer and sparser over time, making future waxing sessions less painful
        and quicker.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Exfoliation :</h6> Waxing not only removes hair but also exfoliates
        the skin, removing dead skin cells and leaving the skin soft and smooth.
