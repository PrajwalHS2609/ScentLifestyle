      <h3>Benefits of Face Waxing</h3>
      <li>
        <h6>Long-lasting Results:</h6> Unlike shaving, which only removes hair
        at the surface, waxing removes hair from the root. This means your skin
        stays smooth for longer.

      <li>
        <h6> Reduced Hair Growth:</h6> Regular waxing can lead to finer and
        sparser hair growth over time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Exfoliation:</h6> Waxing also exfoliates the skin, removing dead
        skin cells and leaving your complexion brighter and more radiant.{" "}
