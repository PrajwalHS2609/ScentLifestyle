          and I couldn’t be happier! The technician was so skilled and made sure
          I was comfortable the entire time. My lashes look amazing, and I’ve
          received so many compliments. I highly recommend SCENT for Eye Lashes

          <span className="quote">“</span>The lash lift and tint I got at SCENT
          was exactly what I needed. My natural lashes look so much longer and
          fuller now. The process was quick and easy, and the results are
          fantastic. This is definitely the best place for Eye Lashes in Jakkur.
