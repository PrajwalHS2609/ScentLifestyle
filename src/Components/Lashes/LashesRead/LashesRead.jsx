            Eyelash extensions are a cosmetic treatment where artificial lashes
            are delicately applied to your natural lashes, creating a fuller,
            longer, and more defined appearance. At SCENT Salon, we offer a
            variety of extensions, including mink, silk, synthetic, and hybrid,
            each with unique properties and benefits.

            The longevity of eyelash extensions varies based on factors such as
            the type of extensions, adhesive quality, and individual lash growth
            cycle. Typically, extensions can last from two to six weeks before
            requiring a touch-up or replacement.
          </li>
          <li>
            When properly applied and maintained, lash extensions should not
            harm your natural lashes. However, improper application, removal, or
            inadequate care can potentially damage or weaken your natural lashes
            over time. Trust our skilled technicians for safe and
            beautifulÂ results.
