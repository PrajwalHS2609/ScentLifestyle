        <p>
          Acrylic nails are the most popular choice for those looking for
          long-lasting nail extensions near Meadows Whitefield. They are
          perfect for individuals who have weaker nails or want nails that can
          withstand daily wear and tear. Acrylic nails are applied by mixing a
          liquid monomer and powder polymer to create a sturdy nail extension
          that is both strong and flexible.

          Gel nail extensions are another great option for nail extensions

          lighter than acrylic nails. Gel nails are perfect for individuals
          who prefer a more subtle, elegant look. The gel is cured under UV

          risk of chipping or cracking.
