        to suit different styles and occasions. Here’s a breakdown of the lash
        types you can choose from at SCENT:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>1. Classic Lash Extensions</h6>
        <p>
          For those who prefer a more natural and subtle look, our classic lash
          extensions are the ideal choice. These extensions involve attaching a
          single extension to each individual natural lash, creating a beautiful
          and natural enhancement. Classic lashes are perfect for those who want
          to add length and a slight volume boost without going over the top.

          are lightweight and comfortable, ensuring a barely-there feel while
          still providing noticeable results. They are perfect for everyday wear
          and are a great option for first-time lash extension clients.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>2. Volume Lash Extensions</h6>
        <p>
          For clients seeking a fuller, more glamorous look, our volume lashes
          are the way to go. Volume lash extensions involve attaching multiple
          lightweight extensions to each natural lash, creating a more dramatic
          and voluminous appearance.

        <h6>3. Hybrid Lash Extensions</h6>

          Can’t decide between classic and volume lashes? Our hybrid lash
          extensions offer the best of both worlds. By combining the two
          techniques, we create a unique, textured look that gives you length
          and volume without being too dramatic.

          are perfect for those who want a slightly more voluminous look than
          classic lashes but still prefer a more natural appearance than full
          volume lashes. They provide the ideal balance for clients who want
          something versatile and elegant.

        <h6>4. Lash Lifts and Tints</h6>
        <p>
          Not quite ready for extensions? No problem! At SCENT, we also offer
          lash lifts and tints as part of our{" "}

          services. Lash lifts are a great option for enhancing your natural
          lashes by giving them a curled and lifted appearance that lasts for
          several weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Combined with a lash tint, your lashes will appear darker, longer, and
          fuller without the need for extensions. Lash lifts and tints are ideal
          for clients who want a low-maintenance option that enhances their
          natural beauty.
