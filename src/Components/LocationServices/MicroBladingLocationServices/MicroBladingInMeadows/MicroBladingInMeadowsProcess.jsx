      <h3>The Eyebrow Microblading Process </h3>
      <p>
        If you're curious about what to expect during your Eyebrow Microblading
        in Meadows Whitefield appointment, here's a brief overview of the
        process:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>1. Consultation:</h6>
        <p>
          As mentioned earlier, the process begins with a consultation where we
          discuss your desired brow shape and style. We may also do a patch test
          to ensure that you're not allergic to the pigment used in the
          procedure.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>2. Mapping and Design: </h6>
        <p>
          Once we have a clear understanding of your preferences, we'll begin
          the brow mapping process. This involves measuring and outlining your
          ideal brow shape to ensure perfect symmetry and proportion.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 3. Numbing: </h6>
        <p>
          To minimize discomfort, a numbing cream is applied to the eyebrow area
          before the microblading begins.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 4. Microblading:</h6>
        <p>
          Using a handheld tool, the technician creates fine, hair-like strokes
          to fill in your brows. The process is precise and careful, ensuring
          that the results look natural and beautiful.
        </p>
