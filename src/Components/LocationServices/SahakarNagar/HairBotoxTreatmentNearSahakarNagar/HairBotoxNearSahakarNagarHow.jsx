      <h3>How Does Hair Botox Treatment Work?</h3>
      <p>
        The process of Hair Botox Treatments near Sahakara Nagar typically
        involves the following steps:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6> 1. Consultation </h6>
        <p>
          Before starting the treatment, you’ll have a consultation with one of
          our hair experts. During this session, we’ll discuss your hair’s
          condition, the goals you wish to achieve, and determine if Hair Botox
          Treatments near Sahakara Nagar are right for you.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 2. Shampoo and Cleanse</h6>
        <p>
          Your stylist will begin by washing your hair with a clarifying shampoo
          to remove any buildup and prepare your hair for the treatment. This
          step ensures that the Hair Botox Treatments near Sahakara Nagar will
          penetrate deep into the hair strands.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>3. Application of Botox Treatment</h6>
        <p>
          Next, the hair botox product is applied evenly to the hair, focusing
          on the ends and any damaged areas. The treatment is left to sit for a
          specific amount of time, allowing the nourishing ingredients to deeply
          hydrate and repair the hair.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>4. Heat Application</h6>
        <p>
          To activate the treatment, a heat source is applied to the hair,
          allowing the product to be absorbed fully. This step helps to enhance
          the effects of the treatment, ensuring that your hair receives maximum
          hydration and repair.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 5. Rinse and Style</h6>
        <p>
          After the treatment is complete, your hair will be rinsed, and you’ll
          be styled according to your preference. The results are instant, and
          you’ll notice that your hair feels smoother, healthier, and more
          manageable.
