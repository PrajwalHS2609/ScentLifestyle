        <h3>What is Hair Botox?</h3>
        <p>
          Hair Botox is a deep conditioning treatment that helps to restore and
          rejuvenate damaged, dry, and over-processed hair. It’s not botox in
          the traditional sense (the kind used for facial rejuvenation), but the
          name reflects the treatment’s ability to "revive" and "detox" your
          hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike regular keratin treatments,{" "}
          <a href="">Hair Botox Treatments near Sahakara Nagar </a> don’t
          involve harmful chemicals or formaldehyde. Instead, the treatment uses
          a blend of nourishing ingredients like vitamins, proteins, and natural
          oils that help repair damaged strands, reduce frizz, and add volume.
          This makes Hair Botox Treatments near Sahakara Nagar ideal for people
          with hair that has been affected by heat styling, environmental
          stress, and chemical treatments.
