      <h3>The Process of Hair Botox Treatment at SCENT</h3>
      <p>
        Getting Hair Botox Treatments near Jakkur at SCENT is a simple and
        relaxing process. Here’s what you can expect during your appointment:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6> 1. Consultation</h6>
        <p>
          Your session will begin with a consultation, where one of our
          professionals will assess your hair type and discuss your hair
          concerns. This is also the time to talk about any specific goals you
          have for your hair, whether it’s restoring shine, reducing frizz, or
          repairing damage.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 2. Shampooing</h6>
        <p>
          We begin by thoroughly cleansing your hair with a gentle shampoo to
          remove any buildup, dirt, or oils. This ensures that your hair is
          prepared to absorb the Hair Botox Treatment fully.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 3. Application of Botox Treatment</h6>
        <p>
          Once your hair is clean, the Botox treatment is applied from root to
          tip. The treatment is massaged into your hair to ensure even coverage
          and maximum absorption of the nourishing ingredients.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 4. Heat Activation</h6>
        <p>
          The treatment is then sealed into the hair with heat, typically using
          a hair dryer or straightener. This step helps the treatment penetrate
          deeper into the hair fibers, allowing for maximum effectiveness.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>5. Rinse and Style</h6>
        <p>
          After the treatment has been fully absorbed, your hair will be rinsed,
          and you’ll be styled according to your preference. Whether you prefer
          sleek and straight or voluminous curls, we’ll make sure your hair
          looks stunning.
