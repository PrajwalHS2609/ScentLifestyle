      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={checked} alt="checked" /> Avoid washing your hair for 48
            hours:
          </span>
          <p>

        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={checked} alt="checked" />
            Use sulfate-free shampoos:{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            Sulfates can strip your hair of essential oils, so opt for a gentle,
            sulfate-free shampoo to preserve the results.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>
            <img src={checked} alt="checked" />
            Limit heat styling:{" "}
          </span>
          <p>
            While Hair Botox Treatments near Lavelle Road can help reduce frizz,
            excessive heat styling may cause damage. Try to limit the use of
            flat irons and curling wands.

        </li>

        <li>
          <span>
