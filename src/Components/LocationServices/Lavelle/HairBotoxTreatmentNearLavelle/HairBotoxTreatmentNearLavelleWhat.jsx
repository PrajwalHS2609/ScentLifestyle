      <h3>What to Expect During Your Hair Botox Treatment at SCENT</h3>
      <p>
        If you’ve never had Hair Botox Treatments near Lavelle Road, you may be
        wondering what the process entails. Here’s a step-by-step guide to what
        you can expect during your treatment at SCENT:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6> 1. Consultation</h6>
        <p>
          Your experience will begin with a consultation where our expert
          stylist will assess your hair and discuss your hair goals. Whether
          you’re looking to repair damage, reduce frizz, or simply enhance your
          hair’s texture, we’ll determine the best approach to meet your needs.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 2. Shampooing and Cleansing</h6>
        <p>
          Before applying the Hair Botox Treatment near Lavelle Road, your hair
          will be thoroughly cleansed to remove any impurities or buildup. This
          ensures that the treatment can fully penetrate the hair cuticle and
          work its magic.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>3. Application of the Botox Treatment</h6>
        <p>
          The Hair Botox Treatment will then be applied to your hair. This
          nourishing formula is carefully massaged into each strand to ensure
          full coverage. The treatment will be left to sit for a few minutes to
          allow the ingredients to absorb into your hair.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 4. Heat Activation</h6>
        <p>
          To enhance the effectiveness of the treatment, heat will be used to
          activate the Botox formula. This step helps the ingredients deeply
          penetrate the hair follicles, repairing damage and ensuring
          long-lasting results.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 5. Rinsing and Styling</h6>
        <p>
          Once the treatment has had time to work, your hair will be rinsed, and
          you’ll be styled according to your preferences. Whether you want
          sleek, straight hair or voluminous curls, our stylists will ensure you
          leave with hair that looks fabulous.
