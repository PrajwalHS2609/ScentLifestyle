      <h3>The Microblading Process at SCENT Hair & Beauty Salon</h3>
      <p>
        When you choose eyebrow microblading in Lavelle Road at SCENT Hair &
        Beauty Salon, you can expect a thorough and professional process
        designed to deliver the best possible results. Hereâ€™s what to expect
        during your microblading session:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>1. Consultation:</h6>
        <p>
           Your journey begins with a detailed consultation
          where our technician will discuss your goals, assess your natural
          eyebrows, and recommend the best shape and style for your face. This
          is the time to share your preferences and ask any questions you may
          have about the procedure.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>2. Designing Your Brows:</h6>
        <p>
           Once your consultation is complete, our
          technician will carefully design your new eyebrows using a specialized
          brow pencil. This step is crucial as it allows you to see and approve
          the shape and style before the actual microblading begins. We ensure
          that the design is symmetrical and complements your facial features.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>3. Numbing the Area: </h6>
        <p>
         Before the microblading process begins, a numbing
          cream will be applied to the brow area to minimize any discomfort. Our
          goal is to make the experience as comfortable as possible for you.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>4. Microblading Procedure:</h6>
        <p>
           The microblading process involves creating
          fine, hair-like strokes in the brow area using a handheld tool. Each
          stroke is meticulously crafted to mimic the natural growth pattern of
          your eyebrows. Our technician will carefully implant the pigment into
          the skin, ensuring that the color matches your natural brow hairs for
          a seamless look.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>5. Aftercare Instructions:</h6>
        <p>
           After your eyebrow microblading in Lavelle
          Road session, you will receive detailed aftercare instructions to
          ensure optimal healing and long-lasting results. Proper aftercare is
          essential to maintaining the beauty and longevity of your new brows.
