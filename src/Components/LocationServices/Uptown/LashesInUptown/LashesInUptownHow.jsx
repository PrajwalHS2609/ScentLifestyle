        at SCENT, itâ€™s essential to follow proper aftercare to maintain their
        longevity and health. Here are some tips to keep your lashes looking
        flawless:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6>Avoid Water for 24-48 Hours:</h6>
        <p>
          After your lash appointment, avoid getting your lashes wet for the
          first 24-48 hours. This helps the adhesive set and ensures
          longer-lasting lashes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Be Gentle:</h6>
        <p>
          Avoid rubbing or tugging at your lash extensions. Treat them gently to
          prevent premature shedding or damage to your natural lashes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> Use Oil-Free Products:</h6>
        <p>
          Oil-based makeup removers and skincare products can weaken the lash
          adhesive, causing extensions to fall off more quickly. Stick to
          oil-free products around your eye area.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Brush Regularly:</h6>
        <p>
          Keep your Eye Lashes in Uptown Whitefield looking neat by gently
          brushing them with a clean spoolie brush. This helps prevent tangling
          and keeps them in place.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6>Schedule Regular Fills:</h6>
        <p>
          To maintain the fullness of your lash extensions, schedule regular
          fill appointments every 2-3 weeks. This ensures that any gaps caused
          by natural lash shedding are filled in.
        </p>
