        <h6>Consultation and Brow Mapping:</h6>
        <p>
          Your journey to perfect brows starts with a thorough consultation with
          one of our microblading experts. During this session, we’ll discuss
          your desired look, analyze your facial structure, and perform a brow
          mapping process. This involves drawing a guide on your skin to ensure
          the final result will be symmetrical and flattering. Brow mapping is

        <p>
          Once we’ve finalized your ideal brow shape, we’ll apply a numbing
          cream to minimize any discomfort during the microblading process.
          While the numbing cream takes effect, our technician will help you
          choose the right pigment color that best matches your natural brows.

        <h6>The Microblading Process:</h6>
        <p>
          During the actual microblading process, our technician will use a
          specialized tool to create fine, hair-like strokes on your skin. These
          strokes are filled with the selected pigment, mimicking the appearance
          of real eyebrow hairs. The process takes about 1-2 hours, depending on
          the complexity of your desired brow shape and thickness. Eyebrow
          Microblading in Uptown Whitefield at SCENT is performed with precision
          and care, ensuring each stroke is perfectly placed for natural-looking
          results.

          session, we’ll provide you with detailed aftercare instructions to
          ensure optimal healing. It’s important to follow these guidelines to
          prevent any infections and ensure the pigment settles properly. You’ll
          also be scheduled for a touch-up session 4-6 weeks after your initial
          appointment. This touch-up allows us to perfect any areas where the
          pigment may have faded or adjust the shape if necessary.
