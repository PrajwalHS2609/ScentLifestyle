      <h3>The Process of Hair Botox Treatments Near Whitefield at SCENT</h3>
      <p>
        If you’re new to Hair Botox Treatments near Whitefield, you may be
        curious about the process. Here’s what you can expect when you visit
        SCENT for your treatment:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h6> 1. Consultation</h6>
        <p>
          Your journey to gorgeous hair begins with a personalized consultation
          with one of our expert stylists. During the consultation, we’ll assess
          the condition of your hair and discuss your specific needs and goals.
          Whether you want to repair damage, reduce frizz, or improve texture,
          we’ll recommend the best treatment for you.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 2. Shampoo and Cleanse</h6>
        <p>
          Before applying the Hair Botox Treatment near Whitefield, your hair
          will be thoroughly washed to remove any buildup, oils, or styling
          products. This ensures that the treatment can be fully absorbed into
          the hair and that you get the best possible results.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 3. Application of Hair Botox</h6>
        <p>
          The Hair Botox Treatment near Whitefield will then be applied to your
          hair. The nourishing formula is massaged into each strand to ensure
          full coverage and deep penetration. This is the key step where the
          treatment infuses your hair with the nutrients it needs to repair and
          restore.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 4. Heat Activation</h6>
        <p>
          To activate the treatment, your hair will be covered with a cap, and
          heat will be applied. This allows the Botox formula to deeply
          penetrate the hair follicles and lock in moisture, repairing damage
          and improving texture.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h6> 5. Rinse and Style</h6>
        <p>
          Once the treatment has had time to work its magic, your hair will be
          rinsed, and we’ll style it according to your preference. Whether you
          prefer sleek and straight or voluminous curls, our stylists will
          ensure that your hair looks and feels fabulous.
