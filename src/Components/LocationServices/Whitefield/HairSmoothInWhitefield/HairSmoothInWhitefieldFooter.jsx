        The process of Permanent Hair Smoothening in Whitefield involves deep
        cleansing the hair to remove dirt, oil, and product buildup. A
        specialized smoothening formula is then applied, followed by heat

        mask is applied to replenish moisture and strengthen the hair, leaving
        it soft, glossy, and easy to maintain.
