    <h3>How Does Hair Botox Treatment Work?</h3>
    <p>
      At SCENT, our expert hairstylists follow a step-by-step process to
      ensure optimal results:
    </p>
    <li>
      <h6>Step 1: Hair Analysis and Consultation </h6>
      <p>
        Our professionals assess your hair type, texture, and level of damage
        to customize the Hair Botox treatment according to your needs.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h6> Step 2: Deep Cleansing with Sulfate-Free Shampoo</h6>
      <p>
        We start with a thorough hair wash using a sulfate-free clarifying
        shampoo to remove dirt, oil, and product buildup, preparing your hair
        for deep absorption.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h6>Step 3: Application of Hair Botox Formula</h6>
      <p>
        The Hair Botox solution, enriched with vitamins, proteins, and
        antioxidants, is carefully applied from root to tip to ensure complete
        nourishment.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h6>Step 4: Heat Activation</h6>
      <p>
        To allow the treatment to penetrate deeply, gentle heat is applied
        using a hair steamer or blow dryer.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h6> Step 5: Rinse and Blow-Dry</h6>
      <p>
        After the formula has worked its magic, the hair is rinsed with
        lukewarm water and then blow-dried to reveal soft, smooth, and
        revitalized hair.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h6> Step 6: Styling and Final Touch</h6>
      <p>
        Your hair is styled to perfection, giving you a salon-finish look with
        enhanced volume and shine.
